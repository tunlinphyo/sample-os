She had been my patient for eight years, along with her husband and three children. There was a shyness in her smile, a touch of self-deprecation. She laughed easily. When her ever-youthful face brightened, it was impossible not to respond in kind. My heart still warms—and constricts with sorrow—when I think of Mary. <br><br>",
                    "Mary and I had never talked much until the illness that was to take her life gave its first signals. The beginning seemed innocent enough: a sewing-needle puncture wound on a fingertip failed over several months to heal. The problem was traced to Raynaud’s phenomenon, in which the small arteries supplying the fingers are narrowed, depriving the tissues of oxygen. Gangrene can set in, and unfortunately this was the case for Mary. Despite several hospitalizations and surgical procedures, she was within a year begging for an amputation to rid her of the throbbing ache in her",

By the time she got her wish the disease was rampant, and powerful narcotics were inadequate in the face of her constant pain. <br><br> \t\t\tRaynaud’s can occur independently or in the wake of other disorders. Smokers are at greater risk, and Mary had been a heavy smoker since her teenage years. I hoped that if she quit, normal blood flow might return to her fingers. After many relapses she finally succeeded. Unfortunately, the Raynaud’s proved to be the harbinger of something far worse: Mary was",

Common to them all is an attack by one’s own immune system against the body, causing damage to joints, connective tissue or to almost any organ, whether it be the eyes, the nerves, the skin, the intestines, the liver or the brain. In scleroderma (from the Greek word",

In a few isolated cases, toxins are mentioned as causative factors, but for the most part a genetic predisposition is assumed to be largely responsible. Medical practice reflects this narrowly physical mindset. Neither the",
                    "specialists nor I as her family doctor had ever thought to consider what in Mary’s particular experiences might also have contributed to her illness. None of us expressed curiosity about her psychological state before the onset of the disease, or how this influenced its course and final outcome. We simply treated each of her physical symptoms as they presented themselves: medications for inflammation and pain, operations to remove gangrenous tissue and to improve blood supply, physiotherapy to restore mobility. <br><br>",
                    "One day, almost on a whim, in response to a whisper of intuition that she needed to be heard, I invited Mary to make an hour-long appointment so that she would have the opportunity to tell me something about herself and her life. When she began to talk, it was a revelation. Beneath her meek and diffident manner was a vast store of repressed emotion. Mary had been abused as a child, abandoned and shuttled from one foster home to another. She recalled huddling in the attic at the age of seven, cradling her younger sisters in her arms, while her drunken foster parents fought and",

And no one protected me.” She had never revealed these traumas before, not even to her husband of twenty years. She had learned not to express her feelings about anything to anyone, including herself. To be self-expressive, vulnerable and questioning in her childhood would have put her at risk. Her security lay in considering other people’s feelings, never her own. She was trapped in the role forced on her as a child, unaware that she herself had the right to be taken care of, to",

We confine ourselves to a narrow realm indeed if we exclude from accepted knowledge the contributions of human experience and insight. <br><br> \t\t\tWe have lost something. In 1892 the Canadian William Osler, one of the greatest physicians of all time,",

Today rheumatology all but ignores that wisdom, despite the supporting scientific evidence accumulated in the 110 years since Osler first published his text. That is where the narrow scientific approach has brought the practice of medicine. In elevating modern science to be the final arbiter of our sufferings, we have been too eager to discard the insights of previous ages. <br><br> \t\t\tAs the American psychologist Ross Buck has pointed out, until the",
                    "advent of modern medical technology and of scientific pharmacology, physicians traditionally had to rely on “placebo” effects. They had to inspire in each patient a confidence in his, the patient’s, inner ability to heal. To be effective, a doctor had to listen to the patient, to develop a relationship with him, and he had also to trust his own intuitions. Those are the qualities doctors seem to have lost as we have come to rely almost exclusively on “objective” measures, technology-based diagnostic methods and “scientific” cures.",

More of a jolt was another letter to the editor, a few days later—this time a supportive one—from Noel B.

He engaged in a relationship with another woman, a friend of the family. “I thought, Look what I’ve done for you,” says Natalie. “I’ve jeopardized my own health. I was there for you all summer.

Although she was unaware of it, by the time she was twenty, Jacqueline du Pré was also in the autumn of her life. The illness that was soon to end her musical career was only a few years away. Regret, loss and resignation had all been too abundantly a part of her unspoken emotional experience. She understood Elgar because she had partaken of the same suffering. His portrait always disturbed her. “He had a miserable life, Hil,” she told her sibling, “and",

She briefly left the marriage, acting out her unhappiness through a sexual affair with her brother-in-law—a further example of her uncertain boundaries. Deeply depressed, for a while she wanted nothing to do with the cello. Soon after she returned to both marriage and music, she was diagnosed with MS. <br><br> \t\t\tJacqueline du Pré’s cello voice remained her only voice. Hilary called it her sister’s salvation.

Long before ALS forced him to retire, Gehrig had sustained seventeen separate fractures in his hands. “He stayed in games grinning crazily like a macabre dancer in a gruelling marathon,” someone wrote.

His book has the reader doubled over with laughter, even knowing the author’s fate—exactly as Kaye had intended.

Here is his description of the “ALS personality”: “One seldom sees words like ‘deadbeat’ or ‘lazy’ used in the same sentence as ALS. In fact, one of the only traits ALSers seem to share is an energetic past. In almost every case, victims were either classic over-achievers or chronic workaholics. . . . I’ve been called a workaholic, and I suppose if the work-boot fits . . . but technically, even though I worked all the time, I was never driven by an addiction to work so much as",

She relates that she had lived her life “at a feverish pace.” She was the mother of three children while building a successful business career: “It was a challenge to juggle homemaking,",

I reached many levels of success in the business, being top achiever in Canada for a number of years.

The two met just before Stephen’s diagnosis with ALS and were married shortly afterwards. Due to her own history, Jane was primed to accept the role of devoted and selfless caregiver. I write selfless here advisedly: there was lacking in her a developed, autonomous sense of self, and thus she completely identified with her role as Stephen’s nurse, mother and guardian angel. “I wanted to find some purpose to my existence,” she recalls in her 1993 memoir, Music to Move the Stars,",

                    "was the most commonly identified characteristic of breast cancer patients in a 1974 British study. The investigators looked at a consecutive series of 160 women admitted to hospital for breast biopsy. All subjects were given a detailed psychological interview and self-administered questionnaire. For corroboration, spouses or other family members were also interviewed, separately. Since the psychological testing took place before the biopsy, neither the women nor the interviewers could have prior knowledge of the ultimate diagnosis. “Our principal finding",
                    "was a significant association between the diagnosis of breast cancer and a behaviour pattern, persisting throughout adult life, of abnormal release of emotions. This abnormality was, in most cases, extreme suppression of anger and, in patients over 40, extreme suppression of other feelings.”6 <br><br> \t\t\tA 1952 psychoanalytic evaluation of women with breast cancer had come to similar conclusions. These patients were said to demonstrate “an inability to discharge or deal appropriately with anger, agressiveness, or hostility (which, in turn, was masked by a facade of",
                    "pleasantness).” The researchers felt that patients’ unresolved conflicts were “manifested through denial and unrealistic self-sacrificing behaviours.”7 <br><br> \t\t\tThe research conducted by Dr. Sandra Levy and her associates at the U.S. National Cancer Institute on the relationship between natural killer cell activity and emotional coping patterns in breast cancer concluded that “suppression of anger and a passive, stoic response style seem to be associated with biological risk sequelae.”8 <br><br>",
                    "Repression of anger increases the risk for cancer for the very practical reason that it magnifies exposure to physiological stress. If people are not able to recognize intrusion, or are unable to assert themselves even when they do see a violation, they are likely to experience repeatedly the damage brought on by stress. Recall, from chapter 3, that stress is a physiological response to a perceived threat, physical or emotional, whether or not the individual is immediately aware of the perception. <br><br> \t\t\t“I obviously struggle with the first question that everyone I know who",

I breast-fed my children to twenty-one months. I smoked a little, only when I was young. I didn’t drink too much. I exercised. I watched the fat in my diet. This wasn’t supposed to happen to me.” The speaker is Anna, a mother of three who was in her mid-forties when the suspicious lump was found eight years ago. Anna has one of the breast cancer genes. <br><br> \t\t\tEven in the small minority of cases",
                    "where it is a major predisposing factor, heredity cannot by itself explain who gets breast cancer and who does not. DNA testing has shown that Anna inherited the breast cancer gene from her father. Other relatives with the same gene, older than she is, have not developed breast cancer. Anna is convinced that stress was instrumental in the development of her cancer. Her first husband, a businessman, mistreated her emotionally throughout her marriage. By the time the relationship ended, she was also being physically abused. “If you ask me why I got cancer, I would",

It has been estimated that for the initiation of cancer, lung cells have to acquire as many as ten separate lesions or points of damage on their DNA. Yet, no matter where in the body, such genomic damage “seldom leads to tumour formation. This is principally due to the fact that",
                    "most primary lesions are transient and are readily eliminated by DNA repair or cell death.”7 In other words, DNA repairs itself or the cell dies without replicating its damaged genetic material—which, no doubt, accounts for the fact that most smokers do not develop clinical lung cancer. Where cancer does arise, either DNA repair or the normal process of cell death must have failed. In a 1999 review of psychological effects on lung cancer, researchers from the Ohio State University College of Medicine wrote: “Faulty DNA repair is associated with an increased incidence of cancer. Stress may",
                    "alter these DNA repair mechanisms; for example, in one study, lymphocytes from psychiatric inpatients with higher depressive symptoms demonstrated impairment in their ability to repair cellular DNA damaged by exposure to X-irradiation [X-rays].”8 Impaired DNA repair has also been documented in studies of stressed laboratory animals. <br><br> \t\t\tApoptosis is the scientific term for the physiologically regulated death necessary for the maintenance of healthy tissues. Apoptosis ensures normal tissue turnover, culling",

The wedding took place in the chapel of Vancouver Hospital’s palliative care unit, five days before he died of the skin cancer that had invaded his spine. The bride was eight months pregnant. Except for his father, all Jimmy’s family had gathered to witness the ceremony and to be with him in his final weeks. A month and a day after I pronounced Jimmy’s death, I attended the birth of their",
                    "daughter, Estelle, just as I had helped deliver Linda’s two older children from her first marriage. <br><br> \t\t\tJimmy wasn’t much for doctors. Although he and Linda had been together five years, I had met him only that summer when he visited the office with persistent back pain. It turned out to be the sign of spinal metastases from a skin cancer that had been excised from his leg some years before. The original condition, malignant melanoma, is a life-endangering tumour of melanocytes, the pigmented cells in the skin. A deadly disease with a ready tendency to spread to other",
                    "organs, melanoma often strikes people in the prime of life. <br><br> \t\t\tI did not get to know Jimmy very well, but from our first meeting he impressed me as extraordinarily likeable. He was thirty-one years old, polite and friendly, with sandy-coloured light brown hair, blue eyes, a complexion sprinkled with freckles and a broad, Irish, open-faced look about him. <br><br> \t\t\tThe exposure of fair-skinned individuals to ultraviolet radiation is the major physical risk factor for malignant melanoma. People of Celtic origin appear to be",
                    "especially vulnerable, particularly if, like Jimmy, they have light-coloured hair, freckles and blue or grey eyes. Dark-skinned ethnic groups are at little risk for skin cancer—in Hawaii, skin cancer is forty-five times less common among non-Caucasians than in Caucasians.1 Local dermatologists conduct a “sunscreen patrol” on the beaches of Vancouver in the summertime as a public service, warning sunbathers of the danger they are courting. It is unfortunate that repression is not as easily remediable a problem as inadequate sunscreen. Malignant melanoma has been the subject of",
                    "some of the most persuasive research evidence linking repression and the development of cancer. <br><br> \t\t\tJimmy’s condition deteriorated very quickly, and the chemotherapy and radiation made him feel worse. “I’ve had enough,” he finally said. “This is crazy. I’m dying, and I don’t need to be dying as sick as I am.” Soon after that, his legs became paralyzed, triggering his admission to palliative care. Death followed within a few weeks. Until I left my practice two years ago, Linda and her children remained my patients. When I",
                    "called her recently, she agreed to be interviewed for this book, as did Donna, Jimmy’s older sister. <br><br> \t\t\tI asked Linda to describe her late husband’s personality. “Jimmy was easygoing, laid-back and relaxed. He loved to be around people. I had to think when you asked me about what kind of stresses there were in his life. He wasn’t a very stressed out kind of person. Now, he was a drinker. He had to drink pretty much every day. That’s why I wouldn’t marry him all those years, because of the drinking. He had beer every day—at least four or more.”",
                    "<br><br> \t\t\t“Did it change him at all?” <br><br> \t\t\t“Only if he had a lot more than that. . . . Then he became this very big, lovable bear who wanted to tell everybody how much he loved them. When he drank, he just wanted to hug people. Guys, too, like they were his big brothers. He needed to say to a guy, ‘You’re my buddy,’ and then he would cry.  <br><br> \t\t\t“He wasn’t a violent man, he wasn’t angry or frustrated. He was sad. He had a lot of sadness in him, and I don’t know why.",
                    "<br><br> \t\t\t“There’s only one thing I can think of, some secret that he had about his father that he didn’t want to tell me. He couldn’t talk about it. He did not talk about his emotions. He did not share anything, really.” <br><br> \t\t\t“What kind of a childhood had he had?” <br><br> \t\t\t“He grew up in Halifax. He always said he was a happy kid. His parents stayed together. Both his parents were alcoholics—the father, from what I understand, drank a lot for a long time. I think",
                    "the mother started when Jimmy was a teenager.” <br><br> \t\t\tAs I found out later from Jimmy’s sister, Donna, his senior by two years, their father had been a heavy drinker throughout their childhood. Donna and I had two conversations. “I felt very comfortable with my childhood,” she told me at first. “My younger siblings have a different perspective . . . but I believe we had a very good upbringing. Very happy household . . .  <br><br> \t\t\t“Jimmy was a real little boy, a happy kid. We’d play all the time.",
                    "We’d go out into the backyard and have water fights—you know, those little spray guns. I just see him as a kid with a real happy face.” <br><br> \t\t\t“How do you recall your parents?” <br><br> \t\t\t“My father was the nicest, friendliest man around. He was a very funny man. He was always joking around with us, play-fighting with us, tickling. He used to mimic, used to talk like Donald Duck. People would come over and say, ‘Get your father to talk like a duck.’ <br><br> \t\t\t“He was a comical person, but you had to listen to him. We’d joke",
                    "around with him, but when Dad spoke, the ground shook. . . . When he was annoyed or angry, when enough was enough—that was it. If he told us to do something, you did it.” <br><br> \t\t\t“Why?” <br><br> \t\t\t“Because if not, you’d be punished and yelled at.” <br><br> \t\t\tDonna married and moved to a different town when she was nineteen. Jimmy stayed with his parents until the age of twenty-two. On what was to have been a brief trip to Vancouver, ostensibly",
                    "to see a friend, he called to tell his parents he would not be back. He did not return, except for a rare visit. <br><br> \t\t\t“He just called and said he wasn’t coming home. He left a letter in his top drawer, explaining it.” <br><br> \t\t\t“He escaped.” <br><br> \t\t\t“He did. And the reason why, I remember him saying to my parents, ‘Hey, I couldn’t tell you, because I didn’t want to hurt you. . .’” <br><br> \t\t\t“So Jimmy had the feeling that it",
                    "would hurt his parents for him to be an independent person.” <br><br> \t\t\t“All of us were made to feel that way. For our mother, her children were her world. They were her everything. She tried to do the best she could, but she was very attached to us—even to my detriment but especially to Jimmy’s. In retrospect, I realize we were far too attached, to an unhealthy degree. I think at some point you have to let your children go. I think emotionally, she didn’t let go. I felt obligated, and many times Jimmy did, too. Normally your parents would try to",
                    "understand and accept your separateness as you got older.” <br><br> \t\t\t“Jimmy’s escape to the West Coast physically doesn’t mean that he liberated himself internally.” <br><br> \t\t\t“Of course he didn’t, no. He felt terrible. He felt very, very bad. He did it, but he also had to live with the feelings.” <br><br> \t\t\tAccording to Donna, Jimmy found the burden of his parents’ emotional pain unbearable even at the end of his life. “Just before the Labour Day weekend, my brother phoned me. He told me what was",
                    "going on with the melanoma, but he said, ‘You know, Donna, I can’t phone Mom and Dad, because emotionally I can’t handle it. Could you do it for me?’ I said sure, I’ll do it. So he said, ‘Just make sure that they don’t call me all upset and crying and everything, because I couldn’t take it.’” <br><br> \t\t\tI suggested to Donna that perhaps what she had recalled as Jimmy’s childhood “real happy face” might not have been a genuine face at all. At least in part, it could have been a coping mechanism Jimmy adopted in reaction to his parents’ anxieties and anger. It was a way of",
                    "avoiding the painful impact of their emotions on himself. Soothing his parents’ feelings was accomplished by negating his own. <br><br> \t\t\tDonna called me back a few days later. Our conversation had brought to the forefront many memories. She needed to talk. <br><br> \t\t\t“After you and I spoke, I just went on about my day. I went to bed at night. About four o’clock in the morning I woke up. It was just incredible how many things came out and just kept going through my mind. <br><br>",
                    "“You had mentioned Linda saying that Jimmy had a lot of sadness in him, maybe to do with his dad. I knew Jimmy really, really well, and yes, there was a lot of sadness. I can go way back to the beginning, remembering when he was little. The only time I can recall my dad doing anything with my brother was a little bit of roughhousing on the carpet in the living room. And I see a bunch of smiles and laughs. But other than that, there was never any participation in Jimmy’s life. Never went to the hockey games. Never played with him. <br><br> \t\t\t“The crazy thing is that our father",
                    "always said that he loved us, but he could be so hurtful. I have a brother who is quite heavy, and he’d ridicule him in front of people. He’d say some terrible things to him. And to Jimmy, too. <br><br> \t\t\t“I was never angry with my father—I’ve always covered up for him, maybe knowingly, maybe in an unknowing way. That night, all of a sudden, I got so angry. I started to think of Jimmy and all the things that happened as he was growing up and throughout his life. I kept thinking of all the times my father raised his voice. If he was trying to fix something and he didn’t have",
                    "the right tools, or the screws fell on the floor, or if something didn’t happen exactly the way it was supposed to happen, he would scream and yell, and we were scared. We just fled. All of a sudden I remembered his voice and the screaming and the yelling, and I thought, This is not how you should live. This is not what we should have experienced. <br><br> \t\t\t“Even at the end . . . My father came out to see Jimmy—they drove from Halifax. Actually, my sister and her husband did all the driving; my father drank all the way. They arrived a couple of weeks before",
                    "Jimmy had to go into palliative care. My father walked into the apartment and sat there sipping his beer, not wanting even to go into the bedroom to see his son, to see Jim. <br><br> \t\t\t“We were trying to cover up. We didn’t want Jimmy to realize that his father couldn’t face seeing him—was afraid to see what he was going to look like. Finally, Dad built up enough courage and went into the room, and asked, ‘Jimmy, can I get you anything? Is there something that you want?’ <br><br> \t\t\t“My father came out, went to the",
                    "fridge, and all of a sudden he said, ‘How come there’s no apple juice here? I don’t believe this!’ And he started ranting and raving at all of us in the apartment. We were stunned. Got his coat on and stomped off to the store and came back with apple juice for Jimmy. <br><br> \t\t\t“Then my father went home, and that was it. He never saw Jimmy in the hospital. He went back to Halifax and never saw him again. And the funny thing is, well . . . you know Linda was pregnant with Estelle and they got married five days before Jimmy died. <br><br>",
                    "“He was semi-comatose that day.” <br><br> \t\t\t“Yes, he was drowsy. We’d had to increase his pain medication rapidly.” <br><br> \t\t\t“Well, one of the things I keep remembering is this. . . . After the wedding, he was weak, but he held his hand up and said, ‘Look, look, just like Dad’s ring.’ And his wedding band was identical to my father’s. It’s funny, those were the words that came out of Jimmy’s mouth. Just like Dad’s ring.” <br><br> \t\t\tJimmy’s mode of emotional coping has been extensively documented",
                    "among melanoma patients. An elegant study in 1984 measured the physiological responses to stressful stimuli of three groups: melanoma patients, people with heart disease and a control cohort with no medical illness. Each person was connected to a dermograph, a device that recorded the body’s electrical reactions in the skin as the subject looked at a series of slides designed to elicit psychological distress. The slides displayed statements of an insulting, unpleasant or depressing nature, such as “You’re ugly,” or “You have only yourself to blame.” As their",
                    "physiological responses were being registered, the participants were asked to record their subjective awareness of how calm or disturbed they felt on reading each statement. The researchers thus secured a printout of the actual level of distress experienced by the nervous system of each subject and simultaneously a report of the subjects’ conscious perception of emotional stress. <br><br> \t\t\tThe physiological responses of the three groups were identical, but the melanoma group proved most likely to deny any awareness of being anxious or of being upset by",

(It is not, as it may seem, that the reactivity of the cardiac patients is",
                    "healthy. In between repression and hyper-reactiveness is a healthy median.) This study demonstrated that people can experience emotional stresses with measurable physical effects on their systems—while managing to sequester their feelings in a place completely beyond conscious awareness. <br><br> \t\t\tIt was in relationship to melanoma that the notion of a “Type C” personality was first proposed, a combination of character traits more likely to be found in those who develop cancer than in people who remain free of it. Type A",
                    "individuals are seen as “angry, tense, fast, aggressive, in control”—and more prone to heart disease. Type B represents the balanced, moderate human being who can feel and express emotion without being driven and without losing himself in uncontrolled emotional outbreaks. Type C personalities have been described as “extremely cooperative, patient, passive, lacking assertiveness and accepting. . . . The Type C individual may resemble Type B, since both may appear easygoing and pleasant, but . . . while the Type B easily expresses anger, fear, sadness and other emotions, the",
                    "Type C individual, in our view, suppresses or represses ‘negative’ emotions, particularly anger, while struggling to maintain a strong and happy facade.”3 <br><br> \t\t\tCould it be disease itself that changes someone’s personality, affecting his coping style in a way that may not reflect how he had functioned in life before the onset of illness? Jimmy’s story, related by his wife and sister, illustrates that repression, “niceness” and lack of aggression are lifelong patterns, having their origins in early childhood. As the researchers who studied physiological stress",
                    "responses in melanoma patients noted, “When people are diagnosed with a disease—whether cancer or cardiovascular—they do not precipitously change their usual ways of coping with stress or suddenly develop new patterns. . . . Under stress, people usually mobilize their existing resources and defences.” <br><br> \t\t\tHow do psychological stresses translate into malignant skin lesions? Hormonal factors likely account for the fact that the number of melanoma tumours is increasing in bodily sites not exposed to sunlight. Researchers",
                    "have suggested that hormones may be overstimulating the pigment-producing cells.4 <br><br> \t\t\tThe Type C personality traits associated with melanoma have been found in studies of many other cancers as well. In 1991 researchers in Melbourne, Australia, investigated whether any personality traits were a risk factor in cancer of the colon or the rectum. Over six hundred people, newly diagnosed, were compared with a matched group of controls. Cancer patients, to a statistically significant degree, were more likely to demonstrate the following traits:",

The risk of colorectal cancer with respect to this model was independent of the previously found risk factors of diet, beer intake, and family history.”5 Self-reported childhood or adult unhappiness was also more common among the bowel cancer cases.

They were questioned regarding their emotional coping styles and childhood relationships with parents. Biological data—pulse,",
                    "blood pressure, weight and cholesterol levels—were also recorded, as were habits such as smoking, coffee drinking and alcohol intake. At study’s end, nearly all the subjects had graduated and most were doctors, their ages ranging from thirty to over sixty. At this point, their health status was reviewed; the majority were healthy, but in about equal numbers some had developed heart disease, high blood pressure, mental illness, cancer or had committed suicide. <br><br> \t\t\tWhen the researchers conceived of the project, they had not expected",
                    "to find that cancer would be associated with any pre-existing psychological factors. However, their data showed just such a connection. There were striking similarities between those who had been diagnosed with cancer and the suicide group: “Our results appear to agree with findings that cancer patients ‘tend to deny and repress conflictual impulses and emotions to a higher degree than do other people.’”6 <br><br> \t\t\tThe researchers found that both for the healthy majority and for each disease category there was a distinctive set of psychological",
                    "traits. The lowest scores for depression, anxiety and anger had been originally recorded for the medical students who later developed cancer. They had also reported being the most distant from their parents. Of all the groups, the cancer subjects were the least able to express emotion. Does that mean there is a “cancer personality”? The answer is neither a simple yes nor a no. <br><br> \t\t\tMelanoma illustrates the futility of simplistic reductions to a single origin. Fair skin alone cannot be the cause of this cancer, since not everyone with fair skin will develop",
                    "melanoma. Ultraviolet damage to the skin by itself cannot be sufficient, since only a minority of light-complexioned persons who suffer sunburns will end up with skin cancer. Emotional repression by itself also cannot account for all cases of malignant melanoma, since not all people who are emotionally repressed will develop either melanoma or any other cancer. A combination of these three circumstances is potentially lethal. <br><br> \t\t\tWhile we cannot say that any personality type causes cancer, certain personality features",
                    "definitely increase the risk because they are more likely to generate physiological stress. Repression, the inability to say no and a lack of awareness of one’s anger make it much more likely that a person will find herself in situations where her emotions are unexpressed, her needs are ignored and her gentleness is exploited. Those situations are stress inducing, whether or not the person is conscious of being stressed. Repeated and multiplied over the years, they have the potential of harming homeostasis and the immune system. It is stress—not personality per se—that",
                    "undermines a body’s physiological balance and immune defences, predisposing to disease or reducing the resistance to it. <br><br> \t\t\tPhysiological stress, then, is the link between personality traits and disease. Certain traits—otherwise known as coping styles—magnify the risk for illness by increasing the likelihood of chronic stress. Common to them all is a diminished capacity for emotional communication. Emotional experiences are translated into potentially damaging biological events when human beings are prevented from learning how to",

That learning occurs—or fails to occur—during childhood. <br><br> \t\t\tThe way people grow up shapes their relationship with their own bodies and psyches. The emotional contexts of childhood interact with inborn temperament to give rise to personality traits. Much of what we call personality is not a fixed set of traits, only coping mechanisms a person acquired in childhood. There is an important distinction between an inherent characteristic, rooted in an individual without regard to his environment, and a response to the environment, a",
                    "pattern of behaviours developed to ensure survival. <br><br> \t\t\tWhat we see as indelible traits may be no more than habitual defensive techniques, unconsciously adopted. People often identify with these habituated patterns, believing them to be an indispensable part of the self. They may even harbour self-loathing for certain traits—for example, when a person describes herself as “a control freak.” In reality, there is no innate human inclination to be controlling. What there is in a “controlling” personality is deep anxiety. The infant and child who",
                    "perceives that his needs are unmet may develop an obsessive coping style, anxious about each detail. When such a person fears that he is unable to control events, he experiences great stress. Unconsciously he believes that only by controlling every aspect of his life and environment will he be able to ensure the satisfaction of his needs. As he grows older, others will resent him and he will come to dislike himself for what was originally a desperate response to emotional deprivation. The drive to control is not an innate trait but a coping style. <br><br>",

Not one of the many adults interviewed for this book could answer in the affirmative when asked the following: When, as a child, you felt sad, upset or angry, was there anyone you could talk to—even when he or she was the one who had triggered your negative emotions? In a quarter century of clinical practice, including a decade of palliative work, I have never heard anyone with cancer or with any chronic illness or condition say yes to that question. Many children are conditioned in",

A friend of hers told",

When her husband, Chris, suffered an acute but debilitating illness, she cared for him with maternal concern and devotion, calling the doctors, nursing him at nights, ensuring that he was well looked after while she was at work.

Her bowel specialist had recommended that the entire large intestine be removed as the only way of controlling her Crohn’s disease. “If they said I needed surgery, I was ready to accept that,” she says, “but I was reluctant.” <br><br> \t\t\tFor more than a decade and a half,",
                    "Martha suffered episodes of bleeding from the gut, anemia, fevers, fatigue and abdominal pain. The symptoms began shortly after the birth of her third child. “It was a very busy time in my life, with a lot of confusion. Jerry, my husband, was in his last year of dental school in Montana. I was twenty-three with three kids.” The children were four, two and the baby was only five months old. The family had no income yet, so Martha was doing babysitting and whatever other work she could get. After Jerry’s graduation, the couple moved to Phoenix, where he set up his dental practice.",
                    "<br><br> \t\t\t“I just wasn’t feeling well. Third baby, very tired and drained emotionally. I was completely alone in Phoenix. I had never wanted to come here in the first place. I wanted to live in Montana. And the truth is, he had an affair one night—that’s what pushed me over the top. I began to have abdominal pains.” <br><br> \t\t\tA few months later, the couple returned to Montana for Jerry’s graduation ceremony. “By then I was hemorrhaging from the bowel. I was hospitalized immediately",
                    "because my mother-in-law worked in a medical clinic and she saw I wasn’t well. That was when I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease.” <br><br> \t\t\tCrohn’s is one of the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD. Ulcerative colitis is the other. Both are characterized by inflammation of the bowel but in different patterns. In ulcerative colitis, the more common of the two, the inflammation begins in the rectum and spreads upward. The entire colon may become involved. The inflammation is continuous but confines itself to the mucosa, the",
                    "superficial layer that lines the gut. <br><br> \t\t\tIn Crohn’s disease, the inflammation extends through the entire bowel wall. Most often the ileum, which is the third and final part of the small intestine, and the colon are affected, but Crohn’s may appear in any part of the digestive tract, from esophagus to large intestine. Unlike ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s will skip areas of the alimentary canal so that normal tissue alternates with diseased segments. IBD may be associated with inflammation in the joints, the eyes and the skin. <br><br>",
                    "The symptoms of IBD depend on the site of involvement. Diarrhea is common in both diseases, along with abdominal pain. Patients may need to defecate many times during the day or even find themselves incontinent. When the colon is affected, there will be bloody stools or, as in Martha’s case, frank hemorrhaging. Especially with Crohn’s, patients may experience fever and weight loss. There may be other complications, such as fistulas created by inflammation—tunnels from the intestines to other organs such as the skin or, say, the vagina. <br><br>",
                    "IBD is usually a disease of young people. Although it may occur at any age, most commonly onset happens between the years from fifteen to thirty-five. <br><br> \t\t\tMartha’s symptoms settled quickly in hospital with a course of cortisone. Soon after being discharged she bled again and had to be readmitted. “I got a blood transfusion, but when it was time for discharge, I hemorrhaged again. That time I went into shock. I was in intensive care. Then I got back out and tried to pull my life together. <br><br>",
                    "“I realized that I was probably not wanting to come back to the marriage and the home. I couldn’t figure out why else I kept hemorrhaging whenever it was time for me to leave the hospital. Why didn’t I just leave my husband? I think I must have just been incredibly young. The truth is that when I did come home, he ended up having another affair. I said, ‘I’m going. This is it.’ I should have left then, but I stayed. <br><br> \t\t\t“The next three or four years I was a sick puppy. I was tired a lot.

He never hit me, but he yelled and threatened and was very aggressive. He was also drinking a lot. One time he really humbled me in front of the kids, which was not good at all. He stood right in my face and yelled at me.",
                    "<br><br> \t\t\t“I was a silent sufferer, and he is an incredible manipulator. Everything was always turned on me. I was always made to feel insecure. At times I couldn’t believe how he could twist things to have it be all my fault.” <br><br> \t\t\t“Did anyone suggest to you that there might be any connection between your stresses and your disease?” <br><br> \t\t\t“No. No medical person ever suggested that. But at the Mayo they had an interesting",

It was significant for me.” <br><br> \t\t\tMedical science considers IBD to be “idiopathic,” of unknown causation. Heredity plays a role, but not a major one. About 10 to 15 per cent of patients have a family history of IBD. The risk is estimated to be from 2 to 10 per cent if a first-degree relative has been diagnosed.1 Patients often intuitively feel there",

In fact, research shows that “most people with inflammatory bowel disease believe that stress is a major contributor to illness.”2 <br><br> \t\t\tFor Martha, the immediate stressor in the year before her visit to the Mayo had been the departure of her two teenage daughters, who both left home to attend universities in California.

Sometimes I was lying on the floor of my office, with heating pads, wondering how I would get through the afternoon and how I would drive myself home. It was extremely severe pain and frequent. I had abdominal pain 80 or 90 per cent of the time. There was not a day that, by mid-afternoon, I didn’t have abdominal pain—for years! I’m sure I would have been in emergency many",

I didn’t go, but not because of the lack of severity.” <br><br> \t\t\tWhen not seen as the patient’s neurotic imaginings, the pain of IBS—and of undiagnosed abdominal pain in general—has been, until recently, thought to be caused purely by uncoordinated contractions of the intestines. Hence phrases like spastic colon. Now it has been confirmed that dysfunction in these disorders does",
                    "not lie solely in the gut itself. A key issue is the way that the nervous system senses, evaluates and interprets pain. <br><br> \t\t\tSeveral observations have led to this new understanding of abdominal problems. Of particular interest are new findings on electrical and scan studies of the brain. When parts of the intestine are artificially distended, the response pattern in the brains of persons with functional abdominal pain characteristically varies from the brain activity of subjects who have no complaints of pain.3  <br><br>",
                    "Pain from distension of the colon or other parts of the intestine can also be studied by inserting an endoscope into the bowel and then inflating a balloon attached to the scope. In such studies, the functional patient groups repeatedly exhibit a hypersensitivity to distension. They report that the pain from this procedure is similar to the pain they usually experience. One study compared the effects of balloon inflation in IBS sufferers and controls. “Balloon inflation to 60 ml caused pain in 6 per cent of control subjects and 55 per cent of IBS patients. . . . Estimated gut wall",
                    "tension at different volumes was similar in the two groups. However, the incidence of pain in relation to wall tension was increased by nearly ten-fold in the IBS group.”4 <br><br> \t\t\tParallel observations have been made elsewhere in the digestive tract, from the esophagus to the small intestine. It appears, then, that in functional abdominal pain, physiological messages from the gut are transmitted by the nervous system and received by the brain in an altered fashion. “There is a new area of investigation for patients with these disorders,” Dr. Drossman writes. “After decades of",
                    "studying how IBS patients are distinguished from normals with regard to their gastrointestinal physiology, we are beginning to see differences in brain physiology.” <br><br> \t\t\tA type of scan known as positron emission tomography, or PET, measures the activity of brain regions by recording variations in blood flow. When study subjects experience distension of their rectums, a PET scan will indicate which part of the brain registers a response.

It interprets present stimuli, whether physical or psychological, in light of past experiences, which can date as far back as infancy. Activation in this part of the brain means that some event of emotional significance is occurring. In people who have experienced chronic stress, the prefrontal cortex and related structures remain in a state of hypervigilance, on the lookout for danger. Prefrontal activation is not a conscious decision by the",

The answer emerges when we look not only at human organs but at human lives. There is a high incidence of abuse in the histories of patients with intestinal diseases",

                    "fully two-thirds of the women interviewed had experienced abuse of a physical or sexual nature, or both. Again, abused patients were more likely to undergo various surgeries, such as gallbladder operations, hysterectomies, and laparotomies. They also had “more pain, non-gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, bed disability days, psychological distress, and functional disability compared to those without sexual abuse.”8 <br><br> \t\t\tIt is self-evident that direct physical trauma—a severe brain contusion or the cutting or bruising",
                    "of a nerve—could physiologically disrupt the nervous system. But how does psychological trauma exert its effect on the perception of pain? <br><br> \t\t\tThe nervous system of the gut contains about one hundred million nerve cells—we have as many in the small intestine alone as there are in our entire spine!9 These nerves do more than coordinate the digestion and absorption of food and the elimination of waste—they also form part of our sensory apparatus. The gut responds to emotional stimuli by muscle contractions,",
                    "blood flow changes and the secretion of a multitude of biologically active substances. Such brain-gut integration is essential for survival. Large volumes of blood, for example, may need to be diverted from the intestines to the heart and to the muscles of the limbs at a moment’s notice. <br><br> \t\t\tIn turn, the gut is abundantly supplied with sensory nerves that carry information to the brain. Quite to the contrary of what was believed until recently, nerve fibres ascending from the intestines to the brain greatly outnumber ones",

The resulting physiological events in the gut then reinforce that emotional interpretation. The signals sent back to the brain give rise to gut feelings that we can apprehend consciously. If we lose touch with gut feelings, the world becomes less safe. <br><br> \t\t\tObviously, life would not be livable",

There has to be a threshold below which the brain does not register sensation, below which stimuli are accepted as unremarkable but above which the brain will be alerted to potential danger from within or without. There needs to be, in other words, a well-calibrated thermostat for pain and other sensations. <br><br> \t\t\tWhen there are too many “gut-wrenching” experiences, the",
                    "neurological apparatus can become oversensitized. Thus, in the spinal cord the conduction of pain from gut to brain is adjusted as a result of psychological trauma. The nerves involved are set off by weaker stimuli. The greater the trauma, the lower becomes the sensory threshold. A normal amount of gas in the intestinal lumen and a normal level of tension in the intestinal wall will trigger pain in the sensitized person. <br><br> \t\t\tAt the same time, the prefrontal areas of the cortex will be in a heightened state of vigilance,",

During emotional stress, activity of the cortical regions amplifies the perception of distress. <br><br> \t\t\tDr. Lin Chang is associate professor at the UCLA Medical School and co-director of the UCLA/CURE Neuroenteric Disease Program. He has summarized the current understanding of irritable bowel syndrome this way: “Both external and internal stressors contribute to",
                    "the development of IBS. External stressors include abuse during childhood and other pathological stresses, which alter stress responsiveness and make a predisposed individual more vulnerable to developing IBS. Later in life, infections, surgery, antibiotics and psychosocial stressors can all contribute to IBS onset and exacerbation.”11 <br><br> \t\t\tStress can definitely induce contractions of the intestines. Women who have been sexually abused, for example, are prone to constipation when the muscles in their pelvic floor are chronically",
                    "tight, incapable of relaxing with defecation. Alternatively, as people who have been terribly frightened have experienced, stress can set off uncontrollable movements in the colon. That was graphically illustrated in a young doctor-to-be who became an unwitting guinea pig in an experiment: “The investigators produced an elaborate hoax by suggesting to a fourth-year medical student undergoing a voluntary sigmoidoscopic examination that they were seeing a cancer. This led to increased contractility or ‘spasm’ of the bowel, which persisted until the hoax was",

These type of studies confirmed that stress affects colonic function in normal persons and patients.”12 <br><br> \t\t\tWhat has been discovered about IBS applies to other diseases of the gut. Patricia, in addition to her IBS, suffers heartburn that has seemed to defy medical explanation. She speaks of it with bitterness. “I have this mysterious gastrointestinal problem that has never been diagnosed. I get acid from eating things that are completely bland. I’ve had to cut out anything with any flavour from my diet. <br><br>",
                    "“I keep having tests, and they keep telling me I’m fine . . . or, I should say, one test did show a tiny bit of upset, but they tell me it’s totally out of proportion to what I actually feel. They put that thing up your nose and down into your esophagus, and they measure the amount of acid. There was, they said, a tiny bit of acid, but not enough to cause the degree of pain I’m having. <br><br> \t\t\t“I’ve been on Pantoloc for about three or four years. It’s supposed to wipe out acid completely, and I was only supposed to take it for six weeks. I also take Diovol or",

I still have symptoms of acid, but they can’t find anything.” <br><br> \t\t\tThe medical name for the distressing chronic experience of stomach acid flowing upward into the esophagus is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Researchers in 1992 studied the relationship of reflux symptoms to stress in subjects diagnosed with GERD. While the perception of reflux-associated heartburn by these patients was markedly increased during the stressful stimuli, the objective measures of acid levels were",
                    "unchanged from one stimulus to another. Stress, in other words, lowered the pain threshold.13 <br><br> \t\t\tAn intestinal specialist unfamiliar with the neurophysiology or psychology of pain who looked at Patricia’s lower esophagus through an endoscope could, in good conscience, tell her that the acid reflux he observed was inadequate to explain the degree of her pain. And Patricia, in equally good conscience, would be incensed by what she perceived as the callous dismissal of a symptom that is a source of intense daily discomfort in her life.",
                    "<br><br> \t\t\tThis is not to say that people with GERD do not experience more frequent reflux than other people. They probably do, and, once more, it is a brain-gut problem. Investigators comparing healthy controls with reflux patients found that the resting pressure of the esophageal sphincter was more frequently low in the GERD subjects. The decreased efficiency of the sphincter muscles permitted more episodes of reflux.14 <br><br> \t\t\tHow can the mind and the brain contribute to reflux? It happens by",
                    "means of the vagus nerve, which is responsible for the tone of the muscles of the lower esophageal sphincter. In turn, the activity of the vagus is influenced by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus, as we have seen, receives input from the emotional centres in the cortex that are susceptible to stress. Thus, in GERD, a lower pain threshold is combined with excessive relaxation of the sphincter—both phenomena that can be related to stress. <br><br> \t\t\tThe three women interviewed for this chapter described similar pain experiences, though it is only",

How, then, can we explain their lowered pain thresholds? <br><br> \t\t\tThe downward calibration of the nervous system’s pain “thermostat” does not require abuse; chronic emotional stress is sufficient to diminish the pain threshold and to induce hypervigilance in the brain.

An interesting clue that early relationships may be crucial in the later development of dementia comes from animal experimentation.

When only a year old, Jonathan was separated from his mother, Abigaile. He was not to see her for years. In an autobiographical fragment, Swift claims that the nurse abducted him, but to some biographers that sounds like “a comforting fable.” More likely he was abandoned, since, after a brief reunion, his mother left him once more. <br><br> \t\t\tGulliver’s encounter with that monstrous breast no doubt",

Toward them he would display a “cold, inexpressive anger,” or even physical violence. Sexually he was repressed.

The only possible emotional outlets are limited, unthreatening ones with powerless and submissive women.”3 <br><br> \t\t\tSwift’s lifelong abhorrence of intimacy and his underlying fear of emotional contact or vulnerability are the defensive responses of a child deprived of emotional nurturing, a child who had to learn quickly to fend for himself. “There was, it seems, no one adult who particularly cared for Jonathan, or for whom he particularly cared.” <br><br> \t\t\tIn some highly sensitive individuals there may arise an uncanny",

Anne Ridgeway moved it out of his reach. He shrugged his shoulders, and rocked himself, and said, ‘I am what I am.’ He repeated the words, ‘I am what I am.

Even more intriguing, tangles and plaques have been found in the brains of people who, during life, exhibited no signs at all of suffering from Alzheimer’s.

The repression of negative emotion—for example, the unconscious grief, anger and loathing Jonathan Swift experienced as a result of early deprivation—is a chronic and significant source of damaging stress. Researchers at the Ohio State University have suggested",

When Reagan was first diagnosed at the age of eighty-three, six years after the end of his second presidential term, he wrote poignantly in his farewell message to the American people, “I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life.” It has been a long, sad decline. <br><br>",
                    "Like Swift, Reagan suffered trauma early on. His father, Jack, was an alcoholic. “At four, he could hardly comprehend that his father had been arrested for public drunkenness,” avers Edmund Morris in his unorthodox biography, Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan. “Dutch, a dreamy, mild-mannered boy, remained oblivious to the high cost of alcoholism. He did not understand why he and Neil [his brother], on baseball afternoons, were festooned around the neck with sacks of freshly-popped corn and told to ‘go sell it down in the amusement park.’”11 <br><br>",
                    "Morris, a perceptive biographer, was wrong this time—or only partially right. While a young child may not be cognitively aware of family disgrace, emotionally he is absorbing all the negative psychic vibrations of the stressed family system. An emotional shutdown, a tuning-out of reality, is his brain’s most readily available defence. In consequence, the Great Communicator could speak the language of sentiment but not that of genuine emotion. “Really, there are no words” became Reagan’s mantra, “his standard cliché to express emotion required of him,” writes Morris.",
                    "<br><br> \t\t\tIf the shutting-down of emotion occurs early enough, during the critical phases of brain development, the capacity to recognize reality may become permanently impaired. Reagan had lifelong difficulty telling fact from fiction. “He had an inability to distinguish between fact and fancy,” a former fiancée recalled—an indication that in the child’s mind, and later in the adult’s, fancy replaced painful fact. “Reagan’s memory was selective,” writes the publisher and editor Michael Korda in his own autobiography, Another",

There had been the anecdote he had told Medal of Honor winners about the Eighth Air Force bomber pilot who, when his B-17 was mortally hit by flak, ordered the crew to parachute out. Just as the pilot was about to jump from the flaming aircraft himself, he discovered that the ball gunner was trapped in his turret, wounded and unable to get out of the hatch above him, terrified of dying alone. The pilot took off his parachute. . . . and lay down on the floor so that he could put his arm into the turret",
                    "and hold the dying boy’s hand. “Don’t sweat it, son,” he told the gunner, “we’ll go down together,” as the plane plunged to the ground. <br><br> \t\t\tThis brought tears to Reagan’s eyes and to the eyes of the Medal of Honor winners. The only problem, as the press soon discovered, was that it had never happened. It was a scene from a movie, which the president had unwittingly transposed to real life.12 <br><br> \t\t\tSimilar anecdotes about Reagan abound, as do stories of his poor interpersonal memory. “Dad, it’s",

Mike,” his first-born child once pleaded with him as Reagan blinked at him uncomprehendingly among a group of fellow students. <br><br> \t\t\tThe then-future president once described himself as “the calm vacant center of the hurricane.” Morris writes that there was always about Ronald Reagan’s personality an “immense insularity . . . , the child was already sheathed in a strange calm . . . [a] paralysis of sensibility.” The purpose of that defensive and self-induced paralysis is clear. As another woman who rejected the young",
                    "Reagan’s advances said, “I’ve always known Dutch can’t be hurt.” <br><br> \t\t\tDutch—Reagan’s early nickname from his radio announcer days—could be hurt. He buried the pain and anger deeply. His resulting emotional repression is nowhere more clearly demonstrated than in Reagan’s description of an incident when, at age eleven, he arrived home to find his father outdoors, inebriated. “It was Jack lying in the snow, his arms outstretched, flat on his back. He was drunk, dead to the world. I stood over him for a minute or two. . . . I felt myself fill with grief for my father. Seeing his arms",

In psychotherapy one often sees this kind of “confirmation by denial”: the speaker spontaneously reports not feeling a certain emotion—usually anger—that he had not been asked about in the first place. This self-report would be more valid than he knew. While it is true that he could feel no resentment, that was so only",
                    "because his awareness of feeling had been impaired long ago. He would be reporting, albeit unwittingly, that his rage lay beyond the bounds of consciousness. The negative assertion— “I could feel no resentment”—represented an internal conflict between that rage and the forces of repression. <br><br> \t\t\tReagan’s mother was apparently too self-absorbed and overwhelmed by the stresses of marriage to a philandering and alcoholic husband. She was unavailable to her children—just as, later, Ronald Reagan would be",

On the contrary, the emotions can be too overwhelming to be experienced consciously—but they are physiologically all the more active.

I interviewed him in his office. A large and affable man in his late forties, Robert speaks with a resonant voice and a hearty humour. When he needs to turn his head to answer the phone or to look at you from a slightly different angle, he swivels his whole trunk. There is virtually no movement in his spine. “Everything’s frozen from my neck to my butt,” he says. <br><br>",
                    "When he was twenty-five, Robert began experiencing pain in his heels, followed by twelve years of unremitting pain in the joints of his shoulders and collarbone. He went to doctors a few times but soon gave up. “They keep telling you it is this and that, or it is not this or that. They don’t give you anything for relief. What else are you going to do about it?” He finally saw a rheumatologist, following five years of pain in his hip and legs. <br><br> \t\t\t“I would favour my left leg to the point that I was lying in bed one night and my partner noticed that one leg was smaller than the",
                    "other—the muscles had shrunk because I didn’t use it. Of course, she went into hysterics and made me go to the doctor.” <br><br> \t\t\tIn the twelve years between the onset of his symptoms and his diagnosis, Robert never missed work. In many respects his story was typical. Every trade union official I’ve ever treated in my practice has been beyond overworked. The demands on their time have been enormous, to say nothing of the inherent stress in the job itself, with the constant conflict and the politics, the long unpredictable hours, meetings,",
                    "never-ending duties. “Our pension plans in the labour movement are very, very good,” says Robert. “The reason we have very good pension plans is that nobody lives to sixty-five to collect their pensions . . . or very few! That’s why the pension plan for those of us in the labour movement is so strong. Nobody ever retires.” <br><br> \t\t\tWhen his rheumatic disease began, Robert was travelling about 100,000 miles a year by air all over North America. In 1976, which he calls his worst year, he was on the road for a consecutive period of four and a half months. “Never saw",
                    "home all that time. I was working on a strike in the southern U.S. because I was in an international union that didn’t have anybody with the skills needed. I was in Arkansas and Oklahoma and Georgia, working twelve to fourteen hours a day, six days a week.” He would sleep during “whatever time was left over.” <br><br> \t\t\t“What was going on in your personal life?” <br><br> \t\t\t“Wife, two kids. Labour movement work always kills marriages. I don’t know any of my friends still married to their original wives. There are",
                    "guys that I started with in 1973—some are dead, but some have had two or three, and one guy has had five marriages! This work just chews them up and spits them out. <br><br> \t\t\t“You’re never there and never contribute. I feel bad about it now. At the time I was too stupid to feel bad about it. I didn’t recognize what I had. I’ve got a close relationship with my kids now—they’re grown up.

                    "<br><br> \t\t\t“I don’t think I questioned it, because everybody else was doing the same thing. It was just part of the culture. Dead marriages and booze were just common. I was the first one in my peer group to stop drinking.” <br><br> \t\t\tRobert says he has an addictive personality. “Not just to work. Booze, drugs, women, gambling—the whole nine yards. I haven’t had a drink since September 2, 1980, at 7:40 p.m. That was the last time I had a beer. I got tired of waking up on the floor with my tongue stuck",

That’s the one addiction I haven’t been able to break.” <br><br> \t\t\tWhat drew Robert to union organizing, and what still keeps him committed to it, is the opportunity to improve people’s lives and to work for a more fair, more equitable society. “That’s why you never say no. There’s always so much more to be done. The list of injustices never gets any shorter. I feel very fortunate to be able to contribute to making this a better world.”",
                    "<br><br> \t\t\tRobert has now developed the capacity to say no to excessive demands. Interestingly—and perhaps not coincidentally—he also finds that his ankylosing spondylitis, with the complete fusion of his ribs and his vertebrae, has conferred an unexpected benefit in emotional expression. <br><br> \t\t\t“I have an advantage over others in terms of expressing anger. I have a command of the language. I never shout at anybody. I don’t have to shout because I can put words right through you just by",
                    "controlling my breathing. One of the good things about AS is that freezes your ribs, so your ribs are locked in front and back.” Robert explains that when people become upset and lose control of their angry responses, they breathe in a very shallow fashion, using the muscles between the ribs to inflate the chest cavity and thus to draw air into the lungs. Because of his AS, he is unable to do that.  <br><br> \t\t\t“In order to have a stronger voice and more control over the way you speak, you have to breathe with your diaphragm. You don’t breathe there—you breathe shallowly and",
                    "your ribs move in and out. My gut goes up and down because I have to breathe with my diaphragm. There’s much more muscle control in the diaphragm than there is over top of the ribs.” It also affords better emotional control and ensures improved oxygen supply to the thinking parts of the brain. <br><br> \t\t\t“Before, I had to work at it. As my ribs froze up, I didn’t have any choice.” <br><br> \t\t\t“That’s most interesting. Teachers of yogic breathing are always telling us to breathe using the diaphragm. That’s the healthy",
                    "thing to do. Your AS forced you to do that.” <br><br> \t\t\t“It gives me the power of clarity. You can tell if most people are angry because they shout at you. That’s the way, verbally, they can express that they’re angry. With my breathing the way it is, I have to speak in shorter sentences, and I can clip words and project my voice rather than yell. Controlling your breathing allows you to control your temper and your anger—and by controlling I mean using it to get to where you want to go.” <br><br>",
                    "As Robert spoke, I was struck by the uncanny ability of nature to teach through adult disease lessons that, in a better world, should be learned in childhood and in health. <br><br> \t\t\tOne study pointed to the intriguing possibility that even the painful inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis could serve a protective function: joint tenderness was significantly related to a decrease in stressful events one week later. “The results have important clinical implications,” the researchers concluded. “The dynamic interplay between social-conflict events and joint pain describe a homeostatic",

During the child’s first year of life, researchers observed mother-infant interactions in the home, recording their perceptions. At one year, each infant-mother pair was brought into the laboratory for a brief experiment, called the Strange Situation. “At various times in the twenty-minute procedure, the infant stayed with the mother, with the mother and a stranger, with only the stranger, and alone for up to three minutes.",

One should then be able to study the infant’s responses at separation and reunion. The most useful assessments came at the reunion episode of this paradigm.”6 <br><br> \t\t\tThe baby’s response to the returning mother, it turned out, was programmed by how the mother had interacted with her during the first year of life.

They were soothed easily and returned quickly to spontaneous play. This pattern was called secure. There were also a number of insecure patterns, variously named avoidant, ambivalent or disorganized. Avoidant infants did not express distress on separating from the mother and avoided or ignored the mother on reunion. Such behaviour did not denote genuine self-reliance but the pseudo-autonomy that we noted,",

On all these measures, children who had been securely attached infants scored consistently better than insecurely attached ones. <br><br>",

                    "unconsciously reveals about his own childhood during the course of the attachment interview will predict his own attachment patterns with his children. Thus, AAIs conducted with the parent before the birth of an infant was able to forecast accurately how the infant would behave in the Strange Situation at one year of life. Furthermore, when those children are followed two decades later, their performance in the Strange Situation is found to have accurately predicted their own patterns of narrative in the Adult Attachment Interview. <br><br>",

The point is not to prove that dying people can be useful but to reject the spurious concept that people need to be useful in order to be valued.

In his public talks, as in personal interviews, he likes to throw his audience a scientific curve ball in the form of a question: “What is the brain of the individual cell?” The typical answer he receives, as he did from this interviewer, is: “The nucleus, of course.”",

In the life of the individual cell, not the nucleus but the cell membrane fulfills the functions analogous to the activities of the brain. <br><br> \t\t\tIn human embryological development, both the nervous system and the skin stem from the same tissue, the ectoderm. Individual cells use their membrane as both skin and",

At the same time, it has on its surface the millions of molecular receptors that act as the cell’s sensory organs: they “see” and “hear” and “feel” and—like the brain—interpret the messages arriving from the cell’s external milieu. It also facilitates the exchange of substances and messages with the environment. The cell’s “decision making” also takes place in the membrane and not in the nucleus, where the cell’s genetic material is located. <br><br> \t\t\tAs soon as we understand this",

In this case, absent is any recollection of how a child might feel who lacks the safety of confessing to her parents her terror and rage at repeatedly being imprisoned alone in a dark room. This lack of safety was confirmed by a more painful episode that occurred in Pamela’s adolescence, when she did seek her mother’s help and intervention regarding a troubling situation in the classroom. Pamela’s mother was a teacher in the school her daughters attended. “Only once",

As my classmate took a full swing, the bat slipped out of his hands and came flying toward me before striking me directly between the eyes. I have no memory of the moment of impact. <br><br> \t\t\tThe bat smashed into my face with such force that it crushed my nose into a distorted U-shape. The collision sent the soft tissue of my brain slamming into the inside of",

In a fraction of a second, I had a broken nose, multiple skull fractures, and two shattered eye sockets. <br><br> \t\t\tWhen I opened my eyes, I saw people staring at me and running over to help. I looked down and noticed spots of red on my clothes. One of my classmates took the shirt off his back and handed it to me. I used it to plug the stream of blood rushing from my broken nose. Shocked and confused, I was unaware of how seriously I had been injured.",

Bush. <br><br> \t\t\t“What is your mom’s name?” <br><br> \t\t\t“Uh. Um.” I stalled. Ten seconds passed. <br><br> \t\t\t“Patti,” I said casually, ignoring the fact that it had taken me ten seconds to remember my own mother’s name.",

I returned home with a broken nose, half a dozen facial fractures, and a bulging left eye. <br><br> \t\t\tThe following months were hard. It felt like everything in my life was on pause.

After months of rehabilitation, what I wanted more than anything was to get back on the field. <br><br> \t\t\tBut my return to baseball was not smooth. When the season rolled around, I was the only junior to be cut from the varsity baseball team. I was sent down to play with the sophomores on junior varsity. I had been playing since age four, and for someone who had spent so much time and effort on the sport, getting cut was humiliating. I vividly remember the day it happened.

                    "I wasn’t going to be starting on the baseball team anytime soon, so I focused on getting my life in order. While my peers stayed up late and played video games, I built good sleep habits and went to bed early each night. In the messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to keep my room neat and tidy. These improvements were minor, but they gave me a sense of control over my life. I started to feel confident again. And this growing belief in myself rippled into the classroom as I improved my study habits and managed to earn straight A’s during my first year. <br><br>",

As each semester passed, I accumulated small but consistent habits that ultimately led to results that were unimaginable to me when I started. For example, for the first time in my life, I made it a habit to lift weights multiple times per week, and in the years that followed, my six-foot-four-inch frame bulked up from a featherweight 170 to a lean 200 pounds. <br><br> \t\t\tWhen my sophomore season arrived, I earned a starting role on",

The organization, which was the governing body for professional cycling in Great Britain, had recently hired Dave Brailsford as its new performance director. At the time, professional cyclists in Great Britain had endured nearly one hundred years of mediocrity. Since 1908, British riders had won just a single gold medal at the Olympic Games, and they had fared even",

In 110 years, no British cyclist had ever won the event. <br><br> \t\t\tIn fact, the performance of British riders had been so underwhelming that one of the top bike manufacturers in Europe refused to sell bikes to the team because they were afraid that it would hurt sales if other professionals saw the Brits using their gear. <br><br> \t\t\tBrailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory. What made him different from previous coaches was his",
                    "relentless commitment to a strategy that he referred to as “the aggregation of marginal gains,” which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. Brailsford said, “The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.” <br><br> \t\t\tBrailsford and his coaches began by making small adjustments you might expect from a professional cycling team. They redesigned the",

They asked riders to wear electrically heated overshorts to maintain ideal muscle temperature while riding and used biofeedback sensors to monitor how each athlete responded to a particular workout. The team tested various fabrics in a wind tunnel and had their outdoor riders switch to indoor racing suits, which proved to be lighter and more aerodynamic. <br><br> \t\t\tBut they didn’t stop there. Brailsford and his team continued to find 1 percent improvements in",

They hired a surgeon to teach each rider the best way to wash their hands to reduce the chances of catching a cold. They determined the type of pillow and mattress that led to the best night’s sleep for each rider. They even painted the inside of the team truck white, which helped them spot little bits of dust that would normally slip by unnoticed but could degrade the performance of the finely tuned bikes. <br><br>",

Thorndike was interested in studying the behavior of animals, and he started by working with cats. <br><br> \t\t\tHe would place each cat inside a device known as a puzzle box. The box was designed so that the cat",

Once the door had been opened, the cat could dart out and run over to a bowl of food. <br><br> \t\t\tMost cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed inside the box. They would poke their nose into the corners, stick their paws through openings, and claw at loose objects. After a few minutes of exploration, the cats would",
                    "happen to press the magical lever, the door would open, and they would escape. <br><br> \t\t\tThorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many trials. In the beginning, the animals moved around the box at random. But as soon as the lever had been pressed and the door opened, the process of learning began. Gradually, each cat learned to associate the action of pressing the lever with the reward of escaping the box and getting to the food. <br><br> \t\t\tAfter twenty to thirty trials, this behavior became so automatic",

You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else. When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what to look for. There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a situation. Your",

These cognitive scripts can be followed automatically whenever the situation is appropriate. Now, whenever you feel stressed, you get the itch to run. As soon as you walk in the door from work, you grab the video game controller. A choice that once required effort is now automatic. A habit has been created. <br><br> \t\t\tHabits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to",

The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future. <br><br> \t\t\tHabit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention for whatever task is most essential. Whenever possible, the conscious mind likes",
                    "to pawn off tasks to the nonconscious mind to do automatically. This is precisely what happens when a habit is formed. Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks. <br><br> \t\t\tDespite their efficiency, some people still wonder about the benefits of habits. The argument goes like this: “Will habits make my life dull? I don’t want to pigeonhole myself into a lifestyle I don’t enjoy. Doesn’t so much routine take away the vibrancy and spontaneity of life?” Hardly. Such questions set up",

In reality, the two complement each other. <br><br> \t\t\tHabits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the people who don’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least amount of freedom. Without good financial habits, you will always be struggling for the next dollar. Without good health habits, you will always seem to be short on energy. Without good learning habits, you will always feel like you’re behind the curve. If you’re always being",

It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity. <br><br> \t\t\tConversely, when you have your habits dialed in and the basics of life are handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges and master the next set of problems. Building habits in the present allows you to do more of what you want in the future.",
                    "<br><br> \t\t\tTHE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK <br><br> \t\t\tThe process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.* Breaking it down into these fundamental parts can help us understand what a habit is, how it works, and how to improve it. <br><br> \t\t\t <br><br> \t\t\t\t <br><br> \t\t\t\t\t <br><br>",

                    "First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards like food, water, and sex. Today, we spend most of our time learning cues that predict secondary rewards like money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and friendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction. (Of course, these pursuits also indirectly improve our odds of survival and reproduction, which is the deeper motive behind",
                    "everything we do.) <br><br> \t\t\tYour mind is continuously analyzing your internal and external environment for hints of where rewards are located. Because the cue is the first indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a craving. <br><br> \t\t\tCravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself but the",
                    "change in state it delivers. You do not crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides. You are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a clean mouth. You do not want to turn on the television, you want to be entertained. Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. This is an important point that we will discuss in detail later. <br><br> \t\t\tCravings differ from person to person. In theory, any piece of information could trigger a craving, but in practice, people are not motivated by the same cues. For a",
                    "gambler, the sound of slot machines can be a potent trigger that sparks an intense wave of desire. For someone who rarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino are just background noise. Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving. <br><br> \t\t\tThe third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much",
                    "friction is associated with the behavior. If a particular action requires more physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you won’t do it. Your response also depends on your ability. It sounds simple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it. If you want to dunk a basketball but can’t jump high enough to reach the hoop, well, you’re out of luck. <br><br> \t\t\tFinally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The",
                    "response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us. <br><br> \t\t\tThe first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving. Yes, rewards provide benefits on their own. Food and water deliver the energy you need to survive. Getting a promotion brings more money and respect. Getting in shape improves your health and your dating prospects. But the more immediate benefit is that rewards satisfy your craving to eat or to gain status or to win approval. At least for a",

Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life, your sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and disappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones. Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle.",

Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur.

This can be more challenging than it sounds because once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly nonconscious and automatic. If a habit remains mindless, you can’t expect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” <br><br> \t\t\tTHE HABITS SCORECARD <br><br> \t\t\tThe Japanese railway system is regarded as one of the best in the world.

When the train approaches a signal, the operator will point at it and say, “Signal is green.” As the train pulls into and out of each station, the operator will point at the speedometer and call out the exact speed. When it’s time to leave, the operator will point at the timetable and state the time. Out on the platform, other employees are",

Before each train departs, staff members will point along the edge of the platform and declare, “All clear!” Every detail is identified, pointed at, and named aloud.* <br><br> \t\t\tThis process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent. The MTA subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that is “point-only,” and “within two years of implementation, incidents of",
                    "incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.” <br><br> \t\t\tPointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. Because the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are more likely to notice problems before something goes wrong. <br><br> \t\t\tMy wife does something similar. Whenever we are preparing to walk out the door for a trip, she verbally calls out the most essential items in her packing list. “I’ve got my",

And when we’ve done something a thousand times before, we begin to overlook things. We assume that the next time will be just like the last. We’re so used to doing what we’ve always done that we don’t stop to question whether it’s the right thing to do at all. Many of our failures in performance are largely attributable to a lack of self-awareness. <br><br>",

The researchers also explained to the group how exercise could reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and improve heart health. <br><br> \t\t\tFinally, there was the third group. These subjects received the same presentation as the second group, which ensured that they had equal levels of motivation. However, they were also asked to formulate a plan for when and where they would exercise over the following week. Specifically, each member of the third group completed the following sentence: “During the",
                    "next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].” <br><br> \t\t\tIn the first and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of people exercised at least once per week. (Interestingly, the motivational presentation given to the second group seemed to have no meaningful impact on behavior.)

Tinbergen—who eventually won a Nobel Prize for his work—was investigating herring gulls, the gray and white birds often seen flying along the seashores of North America. <br><br> \t\t\tAdult herring gulls have a small red dot on their beak, and Tinbergen noticed that newly hatched chicks",
                    "would peck this spot whenever they wanted food. To begin one experiment, he created a collection of fake cardboard beaks, just a head without a body. When the parents had flown away, he went over to the nest and offered these dummy beaks to the chicks. The beaks were obvious fakes, and he assumed the baby birds would reject them altogether. <br><br> \t\t\tHowever, when the tiny gulls saw the red spot on the cardboard beak, they pecked away just as if it were attached to their own mother. They had a clear preference for those red spots—as if they had",
                    "been genetically programmed at birth. Soon Tinbergen discovered that the bigger the red spot, the faster the chicks pecked. Eventually, he created a beak with three large red dots on it. When he placed it over the nest, the baby birds went crazy with delight. They pecked at the little red patches as if it was the greatest beak they had ever seen. <br><br> \t\t\tTinbergen and his colleagues discovered similar behavior in other animals. For example, the greylag goose is a ground-nesting bird. Occasionally, as the mother moves around on the nest, one of",
                    "the eggs will roll out and settle on the grass nearby. Whenever this happens, the goose will waddle over to the egg and use its beak and neck to pull it back into the nest. <br><br> \t\t\tTinbergen discovered that the goose will pull any nearby round object, such as a billiard ball or a lightbulb, back into the nest. The bigger the object, the greater their response. One goose even made a tremendous effort to roll a volleyball back and sit on top. Like the baby gulls automatically pecking at red dots, the greylag goose was following an instinctive",
                    "rule: When I see a round object nearby, I must roll it back into the nest. The bigger the round object, the harder I should try to get it. <br><br> \t\t\tIt’s like the brain of each animal is preloaded with certain rules for behavior, and when it comes across an exaggerated version of that rule, it lights up like a Christmas tree. Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues as supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of reality—like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a stronger response than",
                    "usual. <br><br> \t\t\tHumans are also prone to fall for exaggerated versions of reality. Junk food, for example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy. After spending hundreds of thousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the wild, the human brain has evolved to place a high value on salt, sugar, and fat. Such foods are often calorie-dense and they were quite rare when our ancient ancestors were roaming the savannah. When you don’t know where your next meal is coming from, eating as much as possible is an excellent strategy for survival.",
                    "<br><br> \t\t\tToday, however, we live in a calorie-rich environment. Food is abundant, but your brain continues to crave it like it is scarce. Placing a high value on salt, sugar, and fat is no longer advantageous to our health, but the craving persists because the brain’s reward centers have not changed for approximately fifty thousand years. The modern food industry relies on stretching our Paleolithic instincts beyond their evolutionary purpose. <br><br> \t\t\tA primary goal of food science is to create products that are more",

Companies spend millions of dollars to discover the most satisfying level of crunch in a potato chip or the perfect amount of fizz in a soda. Entire departments are dedicated to optimizing how a product feels in your mouth—a quality known as orosensation. French fries, for example, are a potent combination—golden brown and crunchy on the outside, light and smooth on the inside. <br><br> \t\t\tOther processed foods enhance",

Imagine the gooeyness of melted cheese on top of a crispy pizza crust, or the crunch of an Oreo cookie combined with its smooth center. With natural, unprocessed foods, you tend to experience the same sensations over and over—how’s that seventeenth bite of kale taste? After a few minutes, your brain loses interest and you begin to feel full. But foods that are high in dynamic contrast keep the experience novel and interesting, encouraging you to eat more.",
                    "<br><br> \t\t\tUltimately, such strategies enable food scientists to find the “bliss point” for each product—the precise combination of salt, sugar, and fat that excites your brain and keeps you coming back for more. The result, of course, is that you overeat because hyperpalatable foods are more attractive to the human brain. As Stephan Guyenet, a neuroscientist who specializes in eating behavior and obesity, says, “We’ve gotten too good at pushing our own buttons.” <br><br> \t\t\tThe modern food industry, and the",

While it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by understanding what a craving is and how it works. <br><br> \t\t\tWe begin by examining a biological signature that all habits share—the dopamine spike. <br><br> \t\t\tTHE DOPAMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK LOOP",

By implanting electrodes in the brains of rats, the researchers blocked the release of dopamine. To the surprise of the scientists, the rats lost all will to live. They wouldn’t eat. They wouldn’t have sex. They didn’t crave",

Within a few days, the animals died of thirst. <br><br> \t\t\tIn follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the dopamine-releasing parts of the brain, but this time, they squirted little droplets of sugar into the mouths of the dopamine-depleted rats. Their little rat faces lit up with pleasurable grins from the tasty substance. Even though dopamine was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much as before; they just didn’t want it anymore. The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without desire, action stopped.",
                    "<br><br> \t\t\tWhen other researchers reversed this process and flooded the reward system of the brain with dopamine, animals performed habits at breakneck speed. In one study, mice received a powerful hit of dopamine each time they poked their nose in a box. Within minutes, the mice developed a craving so strong they began poking their nose into the box eight hundred times per hour. (Humans are not so different: the average slot machine player will spin the wheel six hundred times per hour.) <br><br>",
                    "Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing social media—is associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food, drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially. <br><br> \t\t\tFor years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment",

Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right before they place a bet, not after they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine when they see the powder, not after they take it. Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your",

Once a habit is learned, dopamine will not rise when a reward is experienced because you already expect the reward.

After attending college at Dartmouth, Patterson returned to Ohio and opened a small supply store for coal miners. <br><br> \t\t\tIt seemed like a good opportunity. The store faced little competition and enjoyed a steady stream of customers, but still struggled to make money. That was when Patterson discovered his employees were stealing from him. <br><br> \t\t\tIn the mid-1800s, employee theft was a common problem. Receipts were kept in an open drawer and",

Unless you were willing to hover over your employees every minute of the day, or to manage all transactions yourself, it was difficult to prevent theft. <br><br> \t\t\tAs Patterson mulled over his predicament, he came across an advertisement for a new invention called Ritty’s Incorruptible Cashier.

By 1998, over nine million people called it home. It was the economic center of Pakistan and a transportation hub, with some of the most active airports and",
                    "seaports in the region. In the commercial parts of town, you could find all of the standard urban amenities and bustling downtown streets. But Karachi was also one of the least livable cities in the world. <br><br> \t\t\tOver 60 percent of Karachi’s residents lived in squatter settlements and slums. These densely packed neighborhoods were filled with makeshift houses cobbled together from old boards, cinder blocks, and other discarded materials. There was no waste removal system, no electricity grid, no clean water supply. When dry, the streets were a combination of",
                    "dust and trash. When wet, they became a muddy pit of sewage. Mosquito colonies thrived in pools of stagnant water, and children played among the garbage. <br><br> \t\t\tThe unsanitary conditions lead to widespread illness and disease. Contaminated water sources caused epidemics of diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Nearly one third of the children living there were malnourished. With so many people crammed into such a small space, viruses and bacterial infections spread rapidly. It was this public health crisis that had brought Stephen",
                    "Luby to Pakistan. <br><br> \t\t\tLuby and his team realized that in an environment with poor sanitation, the simple habit of washing your hands could make a real difference in the health of the residents. But they soon discovered that many people were already aware that handwashing was important. <br><br> \t\t\tAnd yet, despite this knowledge, many residents were washing their hands in a haphazard fashion. Some people would just run their hands under the water quickly. Others would only wash one hand.",
                    "Many would simply forget to wash their hands before preparing food. Everyone said handwashing was important, but few people made a habit out of it. The problem wasn’t knowledge. The problem was consistency. <br><br> \t\t\tThat was when Luby and his team partnered with Procter & Gamble to supply the neighborhood with Safeguard soap. Compared to your standard bar of soap, using Safeguard was a more enjoyable experience. <br><br> \t\t\t“In Pakistan, Safeguard was a premium soap,” Luby told me. “The",
                    "study participants commonly mentioned how much they liked it.” The soap foamed easily, and people were able to lather their hands with suds. It smelled great. Instantly, handwashing became slightly more pleasurable. <br><br> \t\t\t“I see the goal of handwashing promotion not as behavior change but as habit adoption,” Luby said. “It is a lot easier for people to adopt a product that provides a strong positive sensory signal, for example the mint taste of toothpaste, than it is to adopt a habit that does not provide pleasurable sensory feedback, like flossing one’s teeth.",
                    "The marketing team at Procter & Gamble talked about trying to create a positive handwashing experience.” <br><br> \t\t\tWithin months, the researchers saw a rapid shift in the health of children in the neighborhood. The rate of diarrhea fell by 52 percent; pneumonia by 48 percent; and impetigo, a bacterial skin infection, by 35 percent. <br><br> \t\t\tThe long-term effects were even better. “We went back to some of the households in Karachi six years after,” Luby told me. “Over 95 percent of households who had",
                    "been given the soap for free and encouraged to wash their hands had a handwashing station with soap and water available when our study team visited. . . . We had not given any soap to the intervention group for over five years, but during the trial they had become so habituated to wash their hands, that they had maintained the practice.” It was a powerful example of the fourth and final Law of Behavior Change: make it satisfying. <br><br> \t\t\tWe are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. This is entirely logical.",
                    "Feelings of pleasure—even minor ones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.” Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating. <br><br> \t\t\tTake the story of chewing gum. Chewing gum had been sold commercially throughout the 1800s, but it wasn’t until Wrigley launched in 1891 that it became a worldwide habit. Early versions were made from relatively bland resins—chewy, but not tasty. Wrigley revolutionized the industry",
                    "by adding flavors like Spearmint and Juicy Fruit, which made the product flavorful and fun to use. Then they went a step further and began pushing chewing gum as a pathway to a clean mouth. Advertisements told readers to “Refresh Your Taste.” <br><br> \t\t\tTasty flavors and the feeling of a fresh mouth provided little bits of immediate reinforcement and made the product satisfying to use. Consumption skyrocketed, and Wrigley became the largest chewing gum company in the world. <br><br>",
                    "Toothpaste had a similar trajectory. Manufacturers enjoyed great success when they added flavors like spearmint, peppermint, and cinnamon to their products. These flavors don’t improve the effectiveness of toothpaste. They simply create a “clean mouth” feel and make the experience of brushing your teeth more pleasurable. My wife actually stopped using Sensodyne because she didn’t like the aftertaste. She switched to a brand with a stronger mint flavor, which proved to be more satisfying. <br><br> \t\t\tConversely, if an experience is not",

In an attempt to spend less time with this egomaniac, she acted as dull and as boring as possible whenever he was around.

The world has changed much in recent years, but human nature has changed little. <br><br>",

It made sense to place a high value on instant gratification. The distant future was less of a concern. And after thousands of generations in an immediate-return environment, our brains evolved to prefer quick payoffs to long-term ones. <br><br> \t\t\tBehavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency. That is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent",

A reward that is certain right now is typically worth more than one that is merely possible in the future. But occasionally, our bias toward instant gratification causes problems. <br><br> \t\t\tWhy would someone smoke if they know it increases the risk of lung cancer? Why would someone overeat when they know it increases their risk of obesity? Why would someone have unsafe sex if they know it can result in sexually transmitted disease? Once you",

Smoking might kill you in ten years, but it reduces stress and eases your nicotine cravings now. Overeating is harmful in the long run but appetizing in the moment. Sex—safe or not—provides pleasure right away. Disease and infection won’t show up for days or weeks, even years. <br><br> \t\t\tEvery habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately, these outcomes are",
                    "often misaligned. With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good.

Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.” <br><br>",

The costs of your bad habits are in the future. <br><br> \t\t\tThe brain’s tendency to prioritize the present moment means you can’t rely on good intentions. When you make a plan—to lose weight, write a book, or learn a language—you are actually making plans for your future self. And when you envision what you want your life to be like, it is easy to see the value in taking actions with long-term benefits. We all want better lives for our future selves. However, when the moment of decision arrives,",
                    "instant gratification usually wins. You are no longer making a choice for Future You, who dreams of being fitter or wealthier or happier. You are choosing for Present You, who wants to be full, pampered, and entertained. As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.* <br><br> \t\t\tWith a fuller understanding of what causes our brain to repeat some behaviors and avoid others, let’s update the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is",
                    "immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. <br><br> \t\t\tOur preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth about success: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of satisfaction. The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratification. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded. <br><br> \t\t\tThis is precisely what research has",
                    "shown. People who are better at delaying gratification have higher SAT scores, lower levels of substance abuse, lower likelihood of obesity, better responses to stress, and superior social skills. We’ve all seen this play out in our own lives. If you delay watching television and get your homework done, you’ll generally learn more and get better grades. If you don’t buy desserts and chips at the store, you’ll often eat healthier food when you get home. At some point, success in nearly every field requires you to ignore an immediate reward in favor of a delayed reward.",
                    "<br><br> \t\t\tHere’s the problem: most people know that delaying gratification is the wise approach. They want the benefits of good habits: to be healthy, productive, at peace. But these outcomes are seldom top-of-mind at the decisive moment. Thankfully, it’s possible to train yourself to delay gratification—but you need to work with the grain of human nature, not against it. The best way to do this is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.",

It’s only months later, once you shed a few pounds or your arms gain some definition, that it becomes easier to exercise for its own sake. In the beginning, you need a reason to stay on track. This is why immediate rewards are essential.

The best approach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior.

Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish. <br><br> \t\t\tImmediate reinforcement can be",
                    "especially helpful when dealing with habits of avoidance, which are behaviors you want to stop doing. It can be challenging to stick with habits like “no frivolous purchases” or “no alcohol this month” because nothing happens when you skip happy hour drinks or don’t buy that pair of shoes. It can be hard to feel satisfied when there is no action in the first place. All you’re doing is resisting temptation, and there isn’t much satisfying about that. <br><br> \t\t\tOne solution is to turn the situation on its head. You want to make avoidance visible.

Pass on another month of Netflix? Move $10 over. It’s like creating a loyalty program for yourself. The immediate reward of seeing yourself save money toward the leather jacket feels a lot better than being deprived. You are making it satisfying to do nothing. <br><br> \t\t\tOne of my readers and his wife used a similar setup. They wanted to stop eating out so much and start cooking together more.

Buying a new jacket is fine if you’re trying to lose weight or read more books, but it doesn’t work if you’re trying to budget and save money. Instead, taking a bubble bath or going on a leisurely walk are good examples of rewarding yourself with free time, which aligns with your",

Abbotsford was a relatively small suburb, tucked away in the shadow of nearby Vancouver, where most of the big business deals were being made. Given the location, and the fact that Dyrsmid was a rookie, nobody expected too much of him. But he made brisk progress thanks to a simple daily habit.",
                    "<br><br> \t\t\tDyrsmid began each morning with two jars on his desk. One was filled with 120 paper clips. The other was empty. As soon as he settled in each day, he would make a sales call. Immediately after, he would move one paper clip from the full jar to the empty jar and the process would begin again. “Every morning I would start with 120 paper clips in one jar and I would keep dialing the phone until I had moved them all to the second jar,” he told me. <br><br> \t\t\tWithin eighteen months, Dyrsmid",

Not long after, he landed a six-figure job with another company. <br><br> \t\t\tI like to refer to this technique as the Paper Clip Strategy and, over the years, I’ve heard from readers who have employed it in a variety of ways.

                    "Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paper clips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your progress. As a result, they reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity. Visual measurement comes in many forms: food journals, workout logs, loyalty punch cards, the progress bar on a software download, even the page numbers in a book.

                    "<br><br> \t\t\tA habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit. The most basic format is to get a calendar and cross off each day you stick with your routine. For example, if you meditate on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, each of those dates gets an X. As time rolls by, the calendar becomes a record of your habit streak. <br><br> \t\t\tCountless people have tracked their habits, but perhaps the most famous was Benjamin Franklin. Beginning at age twenty, Franklin",
                    "carried a small booklet everywhere he went and used it to track thirteen personal virtues. This list included goals like “Lose no time. Be always employed in something useful” and “Avoid trifling conversation.” At the end of each day, Franklin would open his booklet and record his progress. <br><br> \t\t\tJerry Seinfeld reportedly uses a habit tracker to stick with his streak of writing jokes. In the documentary Comedian, he explains that his goal is simply to “never break the chain” of writing jokes every day. In other words, he is not focused on how good or bad a particular joke",

Don’t break the chain of sales calls and you’ll build a successful book of business. Don’t break the chain of workouts and you’ll get fit faster than you’d expect. Don’t break the chain of creating every day and you will end up with an impressive portfolio. Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying.",

Habit tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues like the streak of X’s on your calendar or the list of meals in your food log. When you look at the calendar and see your streak, you’ll be reminded to act again. Research has shown that people who track their progress on goals like losing",

One study of more than sixteen hundred people found that those who kept a daily food log lost twice as much weight as those who did not. The mere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it. <br><br> \t\t\tHabit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a distorted view of our own behavior. We think we act better than we do. Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice what’s really",

It is satisfying to cross an item off your to-do list, to complete an entry in your workout log, or to mark an X on the calendar. It feels good to watch your results grow—the size of your investment portfolio, the length of your book manuscript—and if it feels good, then you’re more likely to endure. <br><br> \t\t\tHabit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused on the process rather than the result.",

The first version read, “Bryan’s #1 objective for Q1 of 2017 is to start eating correctly again so he feels better, looks better, and is able to hit his long-term goal of 200 pounds at 10% body fat.” <br><br>",
                    "Below that statement, Harris laid out a road map for achieving his ideal outcome: <br><br> \t\t\t <br><br> \t\t\t\t <br><br> \t\t\t\t\tPhase #1: Get back to a strict “slow-carb” diet in Q1. <br><br> \t\t\t\t <br><br> \t\t\t\t <br><br> \t\t\t\t\tPhase #2: Start a strict macronutrient tracking program in Q2.",

For example, “Write down all food that he consumes each",
                    "day and weigh himself each day.” <br><br> \t\t\tAnd then he listed the punishment if he failed: “If Bryan doesn’t do these two items then the following consequence will be enforced: He will have to dress up each workday and each Sunday morning for the rest of the quarter. Dress up is defined as not wearing jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, or shorts. He will also give Joey (his trainer) $200 to use as he sees fit if he misses one day of logging food.” <br><br> \t\t\tAt the bottom of the page, Harris, his wife, and his trainer all signed the contract.",
                    "<br><br> \t\t\tMy initial reaction was that a contract like this seemed overly formal and unnecessary, especially the signatures. But Harris convinced me that signing the contract was an indication of seriousness. “Anytime I skip this part,” he said, “I start slacking almost immediately.” <br><br> \t\t\tThree months later, after hitting his targets for Q1, Harris upgraded his goals. The consequences escalated, too. If he missed his carbohydrate and protein targets, he had to pay his trainer $100. And",

Phelps has won more Olympic medals not only than any swimmer but also more than any Olympian in any sport. <br><br> \t\t\tFewer people know the name Hicham El Guerrouj, but he was a fantastic athlete in his own right. El",
                    "Guerrouj is a Moroccan runner who holds two Olympic gold medals and is one of the greatest middle-distance runners of all time. For many years, he held the world record in the mile, 1,500-meter, and 2,000-meter races. At the Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, in 2004, he won gold in the 1,500-meter and 5,000-meter races. <br><br> \t\t\tThese two athletes are wildly different in many ways. (For starters, one competed on land and the other in water.) But most notably, they differ significantly in height. El Guerrouj is five feet, nine inches tall. Phelps is six feet, four",

Despite this seven-inch difference in height, the two men are identical in one respect: Michael Phelps and Hicham El Guerrouj wear the same length inseam on their pants. <br><br> \t\t\tHow is this possible? Phelps has relatively short legs for his height and a very long torso, the perfect build for swimming. El Guerrouj has incredibly long legs and a short upper body, an ideal frame for distance running. <br><br> \t\t\tNow, imagine if these world-class athletes were to switch sports. Given his remarkable athleticism,",
                    "could Michael Phelps become an Olympic-caliber distance runner with enough training? It’s unlikely. At peak fitness, Phelps weighed 194 pounds, which is 40 percent heavier than El Guerrouj, who competed at an ultralight 138 pounds. Taller runners are heavier runners, and every extra pound is a curse when it comes to distance running. Against elite competition, Phelps would be doomed from the start. <br><br> \t\t\tSimilarly, El Guerrouj might be one of the best runners in history, but it’s doubtful he would ever qualify for the Olympics as a swimmer.",
                    "Since 1976, the average height of Olympic gold medalists in the men’s 1,500-meter run is five feet, ten inches. In comparison, the average height of Olympic gold medalists in the men’s 100-meter freestyle swim is six feet, four inches. Swimmers tend to be tall and have long backs and arms, which are ideal for pulling through the water. El Guerrouj would be at a severe disadvantage before he ever touched the pool. <br><br> \t\t\tThe secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition.

Like Michael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on the track, you want to play a game where the odds are in your favor. <br><br> \t\t\tEmbracing this strategy requires the acceptance of the simple truth that people are born with different abilities.

They determine your areas of opportunity. As physician Gabor Mate notes, “Genes can predispose, but they don’t predetermine.” The areas where you are genetically predisposed to success are the areas where habits are more likely to be satisfying. The key is to direct your effort toward areas that both excite you and match your natural skills, to align your ambition with your ability. <br><br>",
                    "The obvious question is, “How do I figure out where the odds are in my favor?

He asked each player to “improve their output by at least 1 percent over the course of the season.

But from time to time we might sneak in a completely ‘oddball’ sound – like a strange crunching noise; in response to this sound, a different surge of activity courses through the brain, called the ‘P3a wave’.

But there is no reason why any child who holds an ‘entity’ theory of his or her abilities couldn’t quite easily be taught to change to a more useful and less handicapping ‘incremental’ theory, where they learn to see how success is a product as much of what they do as what they are. ‘Entity’ thoughts",

There is nothing you can do about the genes, but if you choose to believe eminent academics that your behaviour is largely genetically determined, then that belief is likely to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. <br><br> We saw how ‘Terry’ and ‘Tony’ were disabled by an ‘entity’ notion of their intellectual abilities, and how",

Whatever we do, we should not praise a child for being ‘bright’, but rather for their effort, perseverance or ingenuity, otherwise we risk imposing the curse of genetic fatalism on them. <br><br> Rather than praise them for being bright, we should praise them for ‘grit’.

Even where our abilities are very strongly influenced by our biology – as in Alzheimer’s Disease – our brains are too complex for it ever to be a cut-and-dried case justifying our mentally shutting up shop and giving up. <br><br>",

And they can end up being consistently unpopular because they avoid doing the things that could make them accepted – all because they are handicapped by a helplessness-inducing fatalism about the essentially immutable nature of their abilities and characteristics. <br><br>",

It was a contest of enormous importance to the two nations. Italy <br><br> had famously been knocked out of the previous semi-final, in Rome in 1990, when their hero Roberto Baggio kicked the last ball over the net during the penalty shoot-out, causing them to lose 4 – 3 to Brazil.

A typical experiment put pairs of male mice into the mouse equivalent of the boxing ring, and the researchers rigged an otherwise equal contest by slipping a little sedative into one of the animal’s pre-match food. Unsurprisingly, the non-sedated competitor would win but the consequences of this rigged match only emerged in the next bout. When the rigged-match winners were now pitted against a tough, unsedated and hard-eyed opponent, they were more likely to win this real fight than if they had not had the previous victory experience against the sedated",

It was not long before scientists started to measure the ‘sex hormones’ which Landau had only considered as ‘inherent’, or pre-existing factors. But hormones don’t sit in our bodies like milk in the jug: hormones and behaviour are intimately linked, and it became clear that not only did hormones shape behaviour – behaviour changed hormone levels. <br><br>",

In our daily lives, we – men in particular, but more on that later – are constantly challenging and competing with one another other. And how we come out of these challenges depends not just on our state of mind and hormonal activity before the event, but also on whether or not we have won in the past: few of us have a Don King giving us ‘tomato cans’, unequal fights which will give us a testosterone-fuelled advantage against the Frank",

What was going on here? <br><br> Another glimpse into the brain of the California mice gives us a clue. While the androgen receptors in the social aggression part of the brain blossomed after all the victories, whether on home ground or away from home, this was not true of the androgen receptors in the motivation parts of the brain.",

What’s more, it was only the brain-motivation area changes that correlated with the ability to win. <br><br> Winning then – but only at home – reshaped the structure and chemistry of the mice’s brains; but it did not do this by simply turning up raw aggression in the brain, but by also swelling the motivational circuits and upping the will to fight. <br><br> It may seem strange that where you happen to be located determines what changes happen",

This was a major headache for experts in addiction, who regarded heroin addiction as a biologically determined disease that, once established, was very",

His addicted rats could ‘tolerate’ enormous levels of heroin which would kill a non-addicted rat. What puzzled Siegel, given this fact, was how many human heroin addicts were dying of heroin overdoses –",

Once they could take huge amounts of heroin without harm, he then gave the rats a huge test dose – half of them in the same room where they had become addicted, and the other half in a different room with a different colour and smells. The results were astounding: while one third of the rats given the high test",

So the poor addict takes a dose of heroin no bigger than any he has taken before, but falls into a coma and is discovered by some distressed guest a few hours later. The new setting for taking drugs – an unfamiliar bathroom with different sight, sound and smell ‘cues’ – has left his body unprepared – intolerant – to the drug, which surges through his veins and kills him.",

Their ‘room’ where they became addicted was the heat, the fear, the sights, the noise and the smell of Vietnam at war. They returned to a home environment so different that it had none of the ‘cues’ linked to their heroin addiction. Not only was their tolerance to heroin gone, we should infer from Siegel’s research, but so also was the craving that is the dark underbelly of tolerance. They had, in short, left their addiction",

But Tyson’s brain – if Fuxjager’s work applies to humans – may have sprouted extra receptors that sucked up the testosterone and magnified its effect on his brain and on his appetite for the fight. <br><br> The winner effect, then, almost certainly does not work by simply maintaining super-high levels of testosterone until the next contest – winners would likely suffer damage to their heart or risk injury",

But the real effect of winning is in physically shaping the brain, so that the brain behaves like a turbo-charged car that pushes out more power for the same amount of gasoline. <br><br> But these changes are context dependent. Context means place – sights, sounds, smells like those of the White Room or the Vietnam rainforest – and for Mike Tyson it probably included the sounds and smells of the boxing ring. Context",

There was a sharp intake of breath among the watching officials as they saw the sole of Sarkozy’s shoe pointing at the King. Showing the sole of one’s shoe is an insult in the Islamic world, and pointing it at the King was unforgivable. But though the economic power of France may have led the Moroccans to forgive this cultural gaffe, the US Ambassador to Morocco, writing in a leaked memo to the State Department in Washington, noted",

This is a classic characteristic of a dominant human – or any dominant creature for that matter. Alpha types – like the male peacock fanning his tail or the gorilla swelling his chest – physically expand themselves in a display of dominance that asserts their status. <br><br>",

Alternatively, and more alarmingly for the juniors in the room, he might hunch forward over the table, head thrust out, hands clasped well out into the neutral no man’s land of the table. The wary juniors, meanwhile, will be reducing their space as much as possible, just like the diplomats surrounding President Sarkozy.",

Consider this remarkable finding by John Bargh and his colleagues at New York University.30 Students were given five cards, with one word on each – a set like ran fork dog the home, for instance. Their job was to make a four-word sentence out of the five words – the dog ran home. They were tested on thirty such sets and sent away, believing the study had ended.

Not surprisingly, the younger people, who ranged in age from nineteen to thirty, remembered more of the words than the older people, aged from sixty-two to eighty-four; what’s more, the glass ceiling didn’t work",

When their negative stereotypes about age were unconsciously primed, however, their retention of the words dropped to 40 per cent. <br><br> Hess and his colleagues also discovered something else. They",

It means building on the strengths of our history; it means building new alliances; developing new influence; charting a new course for British foreign policy. It means realising once and for all that Britain does not have to choose between being strong with the US, or strong with Europe; it means having the confidence to see that Britain can be both.’",

And boy, they did not like to lose – their cortisol level shot up if they were told they had lost. <br><br> Losing was much less stressful for those with lower power needs. I won’t say ‘like Bill Clinton’ here,",

He was elderly, a shade over six feet tall, and neatly dressed in a blue button-down shirt.1.1 His thick white hair would have inspired envy at any fiftieth high school reunion.",
                    "Arthritis caused him to limp slightly as he paced the laboratory’s hallways, and he held his wife’s hand, walking slowly, as if unsure about what each new step would bring. <br><br> About a year earlier, Eugene Pauly, or “E.P.” as he would come to be known in medical literature, had been at home in Playa del Rey, preparing for dinner, when his wife mentioned that their son, Michael, was coming over. <br><br> “Who’s Michael?” Eugene asked.1.2 <br><br> “Your child,” said his wife, Beverly.",
                    "“You know, the one we raised?” <br><br> Eugene looked at her blankly. “Who is that?” he asked. <br><br> The next day, Eugene started vomiting and writhing with stomach cramps. Within twenty-four hours, his dehydration was so pronounced that a panicked Beverly took him to the emergency room. His temperature started rising, hitting 105 degrees as he sweated a yellow halo of perspiration onto the hospital’s sheets. He became delirious, then violent, yelling and pushing when nurses tried to insert an IV into his",
                    "arm. Only after sedation was a physician able to slide a long needle between two vertebra in the small of his back and extract a few drops of cerebrospinal fluid. <br><br>     The doctor performing the procedure sensed trouble immediately. The fluid surrounding the brain and spinal nerves is a barrier against infection and injury. In healthy individuals, it is clear and quick flowing, moving with an almost silky rush through a needle. The sample from Eugene’s spine was cloudy and dripped out sluggishly, as if filled with microscopic grit.1.3 When the",
                    "results came back from the laboratory, Eugene’s physicians learned why he was ill: He was suffering from viral encephalitis, a disease caused by a relatively harmless virus that produces cold sores, fever blisters, and mild infections on the skin. In rare cases, however, the virus can make its way into the brain, inflicting catastrophic damage as it chews through the delicate folds of tissue where our thoughts, dreams—and according to some, souls—reside. <br><br> Eugene’s doctors told Beverly there was nothing they could do to counter the damage already done,",
                    "but a large dose of antiviral drugs might prevent it from spreading. Eugene slipped into a coma and for ten days was close to death. Gradually, as the drugs fought the disease, his fever receded and the virus disappeared. When he finally awoke, he was weak and disoriented and couldn’t swallow properly. He couldn’t form sentences and would sometimes gasp, as if he had momentarily forgotten how to breathe. But he was alive. <br><br> Eventually, Eugene was well enough for a battery of tests. The doctors were amazed to find that",
                    "his body—including his nervous system—appeared largely unscathed. He could move his limbs and was responsive to noise and light. Scans of his head, though, revealed ominous shadows near the center of his brain. The virus had destroyed an oval of tissue close to where his cranium and spinal column met. “He might not be the person you remember,” one doctor warned Beverly. “You need to be ready if your husband is gone.” <br><br> Eugene was moved to a different wing of the hospital. Within a week, he was swallowing easily. Another",
                    "week, and he started talking normally, asking for Jell-O and salt, flipping through television channels and complaining about boring soap operas. By the time he was discharged to a rehabilitation center five weeks later, Eugene was walking down hallways and offering nurses unsolicited advice about their weekend plans. <br><br> “I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone come back like this,” a doctor told Beverly. “I don’t want to raise your hopes, but this is amazing.” <br><br> Beverly, however, remained concerned. In the rehab hospital it",
                    "became clear that the disease had changed her husband in unsettling ways. Eugene couldn’t remember which day of the week it was, for instance, or the names of his doctors and nurses, no matter how many times they introduced themselves. “Why do they keep asking me all these questions?” he asked Beverly one day after a physician left his room. When he finally returned home, things got even stranger. Eugene didn’t seem to remember their friends. He had trouble following conversations. Some mornings, he would get out of bed, walk into the kitchen, cook himself bacon and eggs, then",
                    "climb back under the covers and turn on the radio. Forty minutes later, he would do the same thing: get up, cook bacon and eggs, climb back into bed, and fiddle with the radio. Then he would do it again. <br><br> Alarmed, Beverly reached out to specialists, including a researcher at the University of California, San Diego, who specialized in memory loss. Which is how, on a sunny fall day, Beverly and Eugene found themselves in a nondescript building on the university’s campus, holding hands as they walked slowly down a hallway.",
                    "They were shown into a small exam room. Eugene began chatting with a young woman who was using a computer. <br><br> “Having been in electronics over the years, I’m amazed at all this,” he said, gesturing at the machine she was typing on. “When I was younger, that thing would have been in a couple of six-foot racks and taken up this whole room.” <br><br> The woman continued pecking at the keyboard. Eugene chuckled. <br><br> “That is incredible,” he said. “All those printed circuits and diodes",
                    "and triodes. When I was in electronics, there would have been a couple of six-foot racks holding that thing.” <br><br> A scientist entered the room and introduced himself. He asked Eugene how old he was. <br><br> “Oh, let’s see, fifty-nine or sixty?” Eugene replied. He was seventy-one years old. <br><br> The scientist started typing on the computer. Eugene smiled and pointed at it. “That is really something,” he said. “You know, when I was in electronics there",
                    "would have been a couple of six-foot racks holding that thing!” <br><br> The scientist was fifty-two-year-old Larry Squire, a professor who had spent the past three decades studying the neuroanatomy of memory. His specialty was exploring how the brain stores events. His work with Eugene, however, would soon open a new world to him and hundreds of other researchers who have reshaped our understanding of how habits function. Squire’s studies would show that even someone who can’t remember his own age or almost anything else can develop habits",
                    "that seem inconceivably complex—until you realize that everyone relies on similar neurological processes every day. His and others’ research would help reveal the subconscious mechanisms that impact the countless choices that seem as if they’re the products of well-reasoned thought, but actually are influenced by urges most of us barely recognize or understand. <br><br> By the time Squire met Eugene, he had already been studying images of his brain for weeks. The scans indicated that almost all the damage within Eugene’s skull was",
                    "limited to a five-centimeter area near the center of his head. The virus had almost entirely destroyed his medial temporal lobe, a sliver of cells which scientists suspected was responsible for all sorts of cognitive tasks such as recall of the past and the regulation of some emotions. The completeness of the destruction didn’t surprise Squire—viral encephalitis consumes tissue with a ruthless, almost surgical, precision. What shocked him was how familiar the images seemed. <br><br> Thirty years earlier, as a PhD student at MIT, Squire had worked alongside a group studying a man",
                    "known as “H.M.,” one of the most famous patients in medical history. When H.M.—his real name was Henry Molaison, but scientists shrouded his identity throughout his life—was seven years old, he was hit by a bicycle and landed hard on his head.1.4, 1.5, 1.6 Soon afterward, he developed seizures and started blacking out. At sixteen, he had his first grand mal seizure, the kind that affects the entire brain; soon, he was losing consciousness up to ten times a day. <br><br> By the time he turned twenty-seven, H.M. was desperate.",
                    "Anticonvulsive drugs hadn’t helped. He was smart, but couldn’t hold a job.1.7 He still lived with his parents. H.M. wanted a normal existence. So he sought help from a physician whose tolerance for experimentation outweighed his fear of malpractice. Studies had suggested that an area of the brain called the hippocampus might play a role in seizures. When the doctor proposed cutting into H.M.’s head, lifting up the front portion of his brain, and, with a small straw, sucking out the hippocampus and some surrounding tissue from the interior of his skull, H.M.1.8, 1.9 gave his consent.",
                    "<br><br> The surgery occurred in 1953, and as H.M. healed, his seizures slowed. Almost immediately, however, it became clear that his brain had been radically altered. H.M. knew his name and that his mother was from Ireland. He could remember the 1929 stock market crash and news reports about the invasion of Normandy.

When it reached the top of the T, it often turned to the right, away from the chocolate, and then wandered left, sometimes pausing for no obvious reason.

It didn’t need to choose which direction to turn, and so decision-making centers of the brain went quiet. All it had to do was recall the quickest path to the chocolate.

To deal with this uncertainty, the brain spends a lot of effort at the beginning of a habit looking for something—a cue—that offers a hint as to which pattern to use. From behind a partition, if a rat hears a click, it knows to use the maze habit. If it hears a meow, it chooses a different pattern.

Eugene was exposed to a cue: a pair of objects always presented in the same combination. There was a routine: He would choose one object and look to see if there was a sticker underneath, even if he had no idea why he felt compelled to turn the cardboard over.

                    "showed something else: that habits are surprisingly delicate. If Eugene’s cues changed the slightest bit, his habits fell apart. The few times he walked around the block, for instance, and something was different—the city was doing street repairs or a windstorm had blown branches all over the sidewalk—Eugene would get lost, no matter how close he was to home, until a kind neighbor showed him the way to his door. If his daughter stopped to chat with him for ten seconds before she walked out, his anger habit never emerged. <br><br>",
                    "Squire’s experiments with Eugene revolutionized the scientific community’s understanding of how the brain works by proving, once and for all, that it’s possible to learn and make unconscious choices without remembering anything about the lesson or decision making.1.22 Eugene showed that habits, as much as memory and reason, are at the root of how we behave. We might not remember the experiences that create our habits, but once they are lodged within our brains they influence how we act—often without our realization. <br><br>",
                    "<br><br> Since Squire’s first paper on Eugene’s habits was published, the science of habit formation has exploded into a major field of study. Researchers at Duke, Harvard, UCLA, Yale, USC, Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania, and at schools in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands, as well as corporate scientists working for Procter & Gamble, Microsoft, Google, and hundreds of other companies are focused on understanding the neurology and psychology of habits, their strengths and weaknesses, and",
                    "why they emerge and how they can be changed. <br><br> Researchers have learned that cues can be almost anything, from a visual trigger such as a candy bar or a television commercial to a certain place, a time of day, an emotion, a sequence of thoughts, or the company of particular people. Routines can be incredibly complex or fantastically simple (some habits, such as those related to emotions, are measured in milliseconds). Rewards can range from food or drugs that cause physical sensations, to emotional payoffs, such as the",
                    "feelings of pride that accompany praise or self-congratulation. <br><br> And in almost every experiment, researchers have seen echoes of Squire’s discoveries with Eugene: Habits are powerful, but delicate. They can emerge outside our consciousness, or can be deliberately designed. They often occur without our permission, but can be reshaped by fiddling with their parts. They shape our lives far more than we realize—they are so strong, in fact, that they cause our brains to cling to them at the exclusion of all else, including common sense.",
                    "<br><br> In one set of experiments, for example, researchers affiliated with the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism trained mice to press levers in response to certain cues until the behavior became a habit. The mice were always rewarded with food. Then, the scientists poisoned the food so that it made the animals violently ill, or electrified the floor, so that when the mice walked toward their reward they received a shock. The mice knew the food and cage were dangerous—when they were offered the poisoned pellets in a",
                    "bowl or saw the electrified floor panels, they stayed away. When they saw their old cues, however, they unthinkingly pressed the lever and ate the food, or they walked across the floor, even as they vomited or jumped from the electricity. The habit was so ingrained the mice couldn’t stop themselves.1.23 <br><br> It’s not hard to find an analog in the human world. Consider fast food, for instance. It makes sense—when the kids are starving and you’re driving home after a long day—to stop, just this once, at McDonald’s or Burger King. The meals are",
                    "inexpensive. It tastes so good. After all, one dose of processed meat, salty fries, and sugary soda poses a relatively small health risk, right? It’s not like you do it all the time. <br><br> But habits emerge without our permission. Studies indicate that families usually don’t intend to eat fast food on a regular basis. What happens is that a once a month pattern slowly becomes once a week, and then twice a week—as the cues and rewards create a habit—until the kids are consuming an unhealthy amount of hamburgers and fries. When researchers at the University of",
                    "North Texas and Yale tried to understand why families gradually increased their fast food consumption, they found a series of cues and rewards that most customers never knew were influencing their behaviors.1.24 They discovered the habit loop. <br><br>     Every McDonald’s, for instance, looks the same—the company deliberately tries to standardize stores’ architecture and what employees say to customers, so everything is a consistent cue to trigger eating routines. The foods at some chains are specifically engineered to deliver immediate",
                    "rewards—the fries, for instance, are designed to begin disintegrating the moment they hit your tongue, in order to deliver a hit of salt and grease as fast as possible, causing your pleasure centers to light up and your brain to lock in the pattern. All the better for tightening the habit loop.1.25 <br><br> However, even these habits are delicate. When a fast food restaurant closes down, the families that previously ate there will often start having dinner at home, rather than seek out an alternative location. Even small shifts can end the pattern. But",
                    "since we often don’t recognize these habit loops as they grow, we are blind to our ability to control them. By learning to observe the cues and rewards, though, we can change the routines. <br><br> IV. <br><br> By 2000, seven years after Eugene’s illness, his life had achieved a kind of equilibrium. He went for a walk every morning. He ate what he wanted, sometimes five or six times a day. His wife knew that as long as the television was tuned to the History Channel, Eugene would settle into his plush chair and",
                    "watch it regardless of whether it was airing reruns or new programs. He couldn’t tell the difference. <br><br> As he got older, however, Eugene’s habits started impacting his life in negative ways. He was sedentary, sometimes watching television for hours at a time because he never grew bored with the shows. His physicians became worried about his heart. The doctors told Beverly to keep him on a strict diet of healthy foods. She tried, but it was difficult to influence how frequently he ate or what he consumed. He never recalled her admonitions. Even if the refrigerator was stocked",
                    "with fruits and vegetables, Eugene would root around until he found the bacon and eggs. That was his routine. And as Eugene aged and his bones became more brittle, the doctors said he needed to be more careful walking around. In his mind, however, Eugene was twenty years younger. He never remembered to step carefully. <br><br> “All my life I was fascinated by memory,” Squire told me. “Then I met E.P., and saw how rich life can be even if you can’t remember it. The brain has this amazing ability to find happiness even when the memories of it are gone.",
                    "<br><br> “It’s hard to turn that off, though, which ultimately worked against him.” <br><br> Beverly tried to use her understanding of habits to help Eugene avoid problems as he aged. She discovered that she could short-circuit some of his worst patterns by inserting new cues. If she didn’t keep bacon in the fridge, Eugene wouldn’t eat multiple, unhealthy breakfasts. When she put a salad next to his chair, he would sometimes pick at it, and as the meal became a habit,",
                    "he stopped searching the kitchen for treats. His diet gradually improved. <br><br> Despite these efforts, however, Eugene’s health still declined. One spring day, Eugene was watching television when he suddenly shouted. Beverly ran in and saw him clutching his chest. She called an ambulance. At the hospital, they diagnosed a minor heart attack. By then the pain had passed and Eugene was fighting to get off his gurney. That night, he kept pulling off the monitors attached to his chest so he could roll over and sleep. Alarms would blare and",
                    "nurses would rush in. They tried to get him to quit fiddling with the sensors by taping the leads in place and telling him they would use restraints if he continued fussing. Nothing worked. He forgot the threats as soon as they were issued. <br><br> Then his daughter told a nurse to try complimenting him on his willingness to sit still, and to repeat the compliment, over and over, each time she saw him. “We wanted to, you know, get his pride involved,” his daughter, Carol Rayes, told me. “We’d say, ‘Oh, Dad, you’re really doing something",
                    "important for science by keeping these doodads in place.’ ” The nurses started to dote on him. He loved it. After a couple of days, he did whatever they asked. Eugene returned home a week later. <br><br> Then, in the fall of 2008, while walking through his living room, Eugene tripped on a ledge near the fireplace, fell, and broke his hip. At the hospital, Squire and his team worried that he would have panic attacks because he wouldn’t know where he was. So they left notes by his bedside explaining what had happened and posted photos of his children on the walls. His wife and",
                    "kids came every day. <br><br> Eugene, however, never grew worried. He never asked why he was in the hospital. “He seemed at peace with all the uncertainty by that point,” said Squire. “It had been fifteen years since he had lost his memory. It was as if part of his brain knew there were some things he would never understand and was okay with that.” <br><br> Beverly came to the hospital every day. “I spent a long time talking to him,” she said. “I told him that I loved him, and about our kids and what a good life we had. I pointed",
                    "to the pictures and talked about how much he was adored. We were married for fifty-seven years, and forty-two of those were a real, normal marriage. Sometimes it was hard, because I wanted my old husband back so much. But at least I knew he was happy.” <br><br> A few weeks later, his daughter came to visit. “What’s the plan?” Eugene asked when she arrived. She took him outside in a wheelchair, onto the hospital’s lawn. “It’s a beautiful day,” Eugene said. “Pretty nice weather, huh?” She told him about her kids and they played with a dog. She",
                    "thought he might be able to come home soon. The sun was going down. She started to get ready to take him inside. <br><br> Eugene looked at her. <br><br> “I’m lucky to have a daughter like you,” he said. She was caught off-guard. She couldn’t remember the last time he had said something so sweet. <br><br> “I’m lucky that you’re my dad,” she told him. <br><br> “Gosh, it’s a beautiful day,” he said. “What do you think about the",
                    "weather?” <br><br> That night, at one o’clock in the morning, Beverly’s phone rang. The doctor said Eugene had suffered a massive heart attack and the staff had done everything possible, but hadn’t been able to revive him. He was gone. After his death, he would be celebrated by researchers, the images of his brain studied in hundreds of labs and medical schools. <br><br> “I know he would have been really proud to know how much he contributed to science,” Beverly told me. “He told me once, pretty",
                    "soon after we got married, that he wanted to do something important with his life, something that mattered. And he did. He just never remembered any of it.”"

                    "<h2>THE CRAVING BRAIN</h2><br><br> How to Create New Habits <br><br> I. <br><br> One day in the early 1900s, a prominent American executive named Claude C. Hopkins was approached by an old friend with a new business idea. The friend had discovered an amazing product, he explained, that he was convinced would be a hit. It was a toothpaste, a minty, frothy concoction he called “Pepsodent.” There were",
                    "some dicey investors involved—one of them had a string of busted land deals; another, it was rumored, was connected to the mob—but this venture, the friend promised, was going to be huge. If, that is, Hopkins would consent to help design a national promotional campaign.2.1 <br><br> Hopkins, at the time, was at the top of a booming industry that had hardly existed a few decades earlier: advertising. Hopkins was the man who had convinced Americans to buy Schlitz beer by boasting that the company cleaned their bottles “with live",
                    "steam,” while neglecting to mention that every other company used the exact same method. He had seduced millions of women into purchasing Palmolive soap by proclaiming that Cleopatra had washed with it, despite the sputtering protests of outraged historians. He had made Puffed Wheat famous by saying that it was “shot from guns” until the grains puffed “to eight times normal size.” He had turned dozens of previously unknown products—Quaker Oats, Goodyear tires, the Bissell carpet sweeper, Van Camp’s pork and beans—into household names. And in the process, he had",
                    "made himself so rich that his best-selling autobiography, My Life in Advertising, devoted long passages to the difficulties of spending so much money. <br><br> Claude Hopkins was best known for a series of rules he coined explaining how to create new habits among consumers. These rules would transform industries and eventually became conventional wisdom among marketers, educational reformers, public health professionals, politicians, and CEOs. Even today, Hopkins’s rules influence everything from how we buy",
                    "cleaning supplies to the tools governments use for eradicating disease. They are fundamental to creating any new routine. <br><br> However, when his old friend approached Hopkins about Pepsodent, the ad man expressed only mild interest. It was no secret that the health of Americans’ teeth was in steep decline. As the nation had become wealthier, people had started buying larger amounts of sugary, processed foods.2.2 When the government started drafting men for World War I, so many recruits had rotting teeth that officials said poor dental hygiene",
                    "was a national security risk. <br><br> Yet as Hopkins knew, selling toothpaste was financial suicide. There was already an army of door-to-door salesmen hawking dubious tooth powders and elixirs, most of them going broke. <br><br> The problem was that hardly anyone bought toothpaste because, despite the nation’s dental problems, hardly anyone brushed their teeth.2.3 <br><br> So Hopkins gave his friend’s proposal a bit of thought, and then declined. He’d stick with soaps and",
                    "cereals, he said. “I did not see a way to educate the laity in technical tooth-paste theories,” Hopkins explained in his autobiography. The friend, however, was persistent. He came back again and again, appealing to Hopkins’s considerable ego until, eventually, the ad man gave in. <br><br> “I finally agreed to undertake the campaign if he gave me a six months’ option on a block of stock,” Hopkins wrote. The friend agreed. <br><br> It would be the wisest financial decision of Hopkins’s life. <br><br>",
                    "Within five years of that partnership, Hopkins turned Pepsodent into one of the best-known products on earth and, in the process, helped create a toothbrushing habit that moved across America with startling speed. Soon, everyone from Shirley Temple to Clark Gable was bragging about their “Pepsodent smile.”2.4 By 1930, Pepsodent was sold in China, South Africa, Brazil, Germany, and almost anywhere else Hopkins could buy ads.2.5 A decade after the first Pepsodent campaign, pollsters found that toothbrushing had become a ritual for more than half the American",
                    "population.2.6 Hopkins had helped establish toothbrushing as a daily activity. <br><br> The secret to his success, Hopkins would later boast, was that he had found a certain kind of cue and reward that fueled a particular habit. It’s an alchemy so powerful that even today the basic principles are still used video game designers, food companies, hospitals, and millions of salesmen around the world. Eugene Pauly taught us about the habit loop, but it was Claude Hopkins that showed how new habits can be cultivated and grown.",
                    "<br><br> So what, exactly, did Hopkins do? <br><br> He created a craving. And that craving, it turns out, is what makes cues and rewards work. That craving is what powers the habit loop. <br><br>  <br><br> Throughout his career, one of Claude Hopkins’s signature tactics was to find simple triggers to convince consumers to use his products every day. He sold Quaker Oats, for instance, as a breakfast",
                    "cereal that could provide energy for twenty-four hours—but only if you ate a bowl every morning. He hawked tonics that cured stomachaches, joint pain, bad skin, and “womanly problems”—but only if you drank the medicine at symptoms’ first appearance. Soon, people were devouring oatmeal at daybreak and chugging from little brown bottles whenever they felt a hint of fatigue, which, as luck would have it, often happened at least once a day. <br><br> To sell Pepsodent, then, Hopkins needed a trigger that would justify the toothpaste’s daily use. He sat",
                    "down with a pile of dental textbooks. “It was dry reading,” he later wrote. “But in the middle of one book I found a reference to the mucin plaques on teeth, which I afterward called ‘the film.’ That gave me an appealing idea. I resolved to advertise this toothpaste as a creator of beauty. To deal with that cloudy film.” <br><br> In focusing on tooth film, Hopkins was ignoring the fact that this same film has always covered people’s teeth and hadn’t seemed to bother anyone. The film is a naturally occurring membrane that builds up on teeth regardless of",
                    "what you eat or how often you brush.2.7 People had never paid much attention to it, and there was little reason why they should: You can get rid of the film by eating an apple, running your finger over your teeth, brushing, or vigorously swirling liquid around your mouth. Toothpaste didn’t do anything to help remove the film. In fact, one of the leading dental researchers of the time said that all toothpastes—particularly Pepsodent—were worthless.2.8 <br><br> That didn’t stop Hopkins from exploiting his discovery. Here, he decided, was a cue that could",
                    "trigger a habit. Soon, cities were plastered with Pepsodent ads. <br><br> “Just run your tongue across your teeth,” read one. “You’ll feel a film—that’s what makes your teeth look ‘off color’ and invites decay.” <br><br>     “Note how many pretty teeth are seen everywhere,” read another ad, featuring smiling beauties. “Millions are using a new method of teeth cleansing. Why would any woman have dingy film on her teeth? Pepsodent removes the film!”2.9 <br><br> The brilliance of these appeals was that they relied upon a cue—tooth",
                    "film—that was universal and impossible to ignore. Telling someone to run their tongue across their teeth, it turned out, was likely to cause them to run their tongue across their teeth. And when they did, they were likely to feel a film. Hopkins had found a cue that was simple, had existed for ages, and was so easy to trigger that an advertisement could cause people to comply automatically. <br><br> Moreover, the reward, as Hopkins envisioned it, was even more enticing. Who, after all, doesn’t want to be more beautiful? Who doesn’t want a prettier smile?",
                    "Particularly when all it takes is a quick brush with Pepsodent? <br><br>      <br><br> HOPKINS’S CONCEPTION OF THE PEPSODENT HABIT LOOP <br><br> After the campaign launched, a quiet week passed. Then two. In the third week, demand exploded. There were so many orders for Pepsodent that the company couldn’t keep up. In three years, the product went international, and Hopkins was crafting ads in Spanish, German, and Chinese. Within a decade, Pepsodent was",
                    "one of the top-selling goods in the world, and remained America’s best-selling toothpaste for more than thirty years.2.10, 2.11 <br><br> Before Pepsodent appeared, only 7 percent of Americans had a tube of toothpaste in their medicine chests. A decade after Hopkins’s ad campaign went nationwide, that number had jumped to 65 percent.2.12 By the end of World War II, the military downgraded concerns about recruits’ teeth because so many soldiers were brushing every day. <br><br> “I made for myself a million dollars",
                    "on Pepsodent,” Hopkins wrote a few years after the product appeared on shelves. The key, he said, was that he had “learned the right human psychology.” That psychology was grounded in two basic rules: <br><br> First, find a simple and obvious cue. <br><br> Second, clearly define the rewards. <br><br> If you get those elements right, Hopkins promised, it was like magic. Look at Pepsodent: He had identified a cue—tooth film—and a reward—beautiful teeth—that had persuaded millions to start a daily",
                    "ritual. Even today, Hopkins’s rules are a staple of marketing textbooks and the foundation of millions of ad campaigns. <br><br> And those same principles have been used to create thousands of other habits—often without people realizing how closely they are hewing to Hopkins’s formula. Studies of people who have successfully started new exercise routines, for instance, show they are more likely to stick with a workout plan if they choose a specific cue, such as running as soon as they get home from work, and a clear reward, such as a beer",
                    "or an evening of guilt-free television.2.13 Research on dieting says creating new food habits requires a predetermined cue—such as planning menus in advance—and simple rewards for dieters when they stick to their intentions.2.14 <br><br> “The time has come when advertising has in some hands reached the status of a science,” Hopkins wrote. “Advertising, once a gamble, has thus become, under able direction, one of the safest of business ventures.” <br><br> It’s quite a boast. However, it turns",
                    "out that Hopkins’s two rules aren’t enough. There’s also a third rule that must be satisfied to create a habit—a rule so subtle that Hopkins himself relied on it without knowing it existed. It explains everything from why it’s so hard to ignore a box of doughnuts to how a morning jog can become a nearly effortless routine. <br><br> II. <br><br> The scientists and marketing executives at Procter & Gamble were gathered around a beat-up table in a small, windowless room, reading the transcript of an",

His hair was a mess. His eyes were tired. “I never thought things would get this bad.",
                    "They told me running this project was a promotion.” <br><br>     It was 1996, and the group at the table was finding out, despite Claude Hopkins’s assertions, how utterly unscientific the process of selling something could become. They all worked for one of the largest consumer goods firms on earth, the company behind Pringles potato chips, Oil of Olay, Bounty paper towels, CoverGirl cosmetics, Dawn, Downy, and Duracell, as well as dozens of other brands. P&G collected more data than almost any other merchant on earth and relied on complex statistical",

The company had spent millions of dollars developing a spray that could remove bad smells from",

And the researchers in that tiny, windowless room had no idea how to get people to buy it. <br><br> The spray had been created about three years earlier, when one of P&G’s chemists was working with a substance called hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin, or HPBCD, in a laboratory. The chemist was a smoker. His clothes usually smelled like an ashtray. One day, after working with HPBCD, his wife greeted him at the door when he got home. <br><br> “Did you quit smoking?” she asked",
                    "him. <br><br> “No,” he said. He was suspicious. She had been harassing him to give up cigarettes for years. This seemed like some kind of reverse psychology trickery. <br><br> “You don’t smell like smoke, is all,” she said. <br><br> The next day, he went back to the lab and started experimenting with HPBCD and various scents. Soon, he had hundreds of vials containing fabrics that smelled like wet dogs, cigars, sweaty socks, Chinese food, musty shirts, and",
                    "dirty towels. When he put HPBCD in water and sprayed it on the samples, the scents were drawn into the chemical’s molecules. After the mist dried, the smell was gone. <br><br> When the chemist explained his findings to P&G’s executives, they were ecstatic. For years, market research had said that consumers were clamoring for something that could get rid of bad smells—not mask them, but eradicate them altogether. When one team of researchers had interviewed customers, they found that many of them left their blouses or slacks outside after a night at a bar or",

They spent millions perfecting the formula, finally producing a colorless, odorless liquid that could wipe out almost any foul odor. The science behind the spray was so advanced that NASA would eventually use it to clean the interiors of shuttles after they returned from space. The best part",
                    "was that it was cheap to manufacture, didn’t leave stains, and could make any stinky couch, old jacket, or stained car interior smell, well, scentless. The project had been a major gamble, but P&G was now poised to earn billions—if they could come up with the right marketing campaign. <br><br> They decided to call it Febreze, and asked Stimson, a thirty-one-year-old wunderkind with a background in math and psychology, to lead the marketing team.2.17 Stimson was tall and handsome, with a strong chin, a gentle voice, and a taste for high-end meals. (“I’d",

Before joining P&G, he had spent five years on Wall Street building mathematical models for choosing stocks. When he relocated to Cincinnati, where P&G was headquartered, he was tapped to help run important business lines, including Bounce fabric softener and Downy dryer sheets. But Febreze was different. It was a chance to launch an entirely new category of product—to add something to a consumer’s shopping cart that had never been there before. All Stimson needed to do was figure out how to make",

They flew in and handed out samples, and then asked people if they could come by their homes. Over the course of two months, they visited hundreds of households. Their first big breakthrough came when they visited a park ranger in Phoenix. She was in her late twenties and lived by herself. Her job was to trap animals that wandered out of the",

The bottle ran out, so she got another one, and sprayed everything else. <br><br> “I’ve asked all of my friends to come over,” the woman said. “They can’t smell it anymore. The skunk is gone.” <br><br> By now, she was crying so hard that one of Stimson’s colleagues was patting her on the shoulder. “Thank you so much,” the woman said. “I",

We’re going to make a fortune with this stuff, he thought. <br><br>  <br><br> Stimson and his team went back to P&G headquarters and started reviewing the marketing campaign they were about to roll out. The key to selling Febreze, they decided, was conveying that sense of relief the park ranger felt. They had to position Febreze as something that",

The second ad featured a woman worrying about her dog, Sophie, who always sits on the couch.2.18 “Sophie will always smell like Sophie,” she says, but with Febreze, “now my furniture doesn’t have to.” The cue: pet smells, which are familiar to the seventy million households with animals.2.19 The reward: a house that doesn’t smell like a kennel. <br><br> Stimson and his colleagues began airing the advertisements in 1996 in the same test cities.

Why do different rewards affect the brain in different ways?” <br><br> Schultz began a series of experiments to decipher how rewards work on a neurochemical level. As technology progressed, he gained access, in the 1990s, to devices similar to those used by the researchers at MIT. Rather than rats, however, Schultz was interested in monkeys like Julio, an eight-pound macaque with hazel eyes who had a very thin electrode inserted into his brain that allowed Schultz to observe neuronal activity",

He didn’t squirm. When a yellow squiggle appeared, he went for the lever. When a blue line flashed, he pounced. And when the juice arrived, Julio would lick his",

Julio started expecting his reward as soon as he saw the yellow spirals and red squiggles. <br><br> Then Schultz adjusted the experiment. Previously, Julio had received juice as soon as he touched the lever. Now, sometimes, the juice didn’t arrive at all, even if Julio performed correctly. Or it would arrive after a slight delay. Or it would be watered down until it was only half as sweet.",

And within Julio’s brain, Schultz watched a new pattern emerge: craving. When Julio anticipated juice but didn’t receive it, a neurological pattern associated with desire and frustration erupted inside his skull. When Julio saw the cue, he started anticipating a juice-fueled joy. But if the juice didn’t arrive, that joy became a craving that, if unsatisfied, drove Julio to anger or depression.",
                    "<br><br> Researchers in other labs have found similar patterns. Other monkeys were trained to anticipate juice whenever they saw a shape on a screen. Then, researchers tried to distract them. They opened the lab’s door, so the monkeys could go outside and play with their friends. They put food in a corner, so the monkeys could eat if they abandoned the experiment. <br><br> For those monkeys who hadn’t developed a strong habit, the distractions worked. They slid out of their chairs, left the room, and",

The anticipation and sense of craving was so overwhelming that the monkeys stayed glued to their screens, the same way a gambler will play slots long after he’s lost his winnings.2.23 <br><br> This explains why habits are so",
                    "powerful: They create neurological cravings. Most of the time, these cravings emerge so gradually that we’re not really aware they exist, so we’re often blind to their influence. But as we associate cues with certain rewards, a subconscious craving emerges in our brains that starts the habit loop spinning. One researcher at Cornell, for instance, found how powerfully food and scent cravings can affect behavior when he noticed how Cinnabon stores were positioned inside shopping malls. Most food sellers locate their kiosks in food courts, but Cinnabon tries to locate their stores away from other food",
                    "stalls.2.24 Why? Because Cinnabon executives want the smell of cinnamon rolls to waft down hallways and around corners uninterrupted, so that shoppers will start subconsciously craving a roll. By the time a consumer turns a corner and sees the Cinnabon store, that craving is a roaring monster inside his head and he’ll reach, unthinkingly, for his wallet. The habit loop is spinning because a sense of craving has emerged.2.25 <br><br> “There is nothing programmed into our brains that makes us see a box of doughnuts and automatically",
                    "want a sugary treat,” Schultz told me. “But once our brain learns that a doughnut box contains yummy sugar and other carbohydrates, it will start anticipating the sugar high. Our brains will push us toward the box. Then, if we don’t eat the doughnut, we’ll feel disappointed.” <br><br> To understand this process, consider how Julio’s habit emerged. First, he saw a shape on the screen: <br><br>  <br><br> Over time, Julio learned that the appearance of the shape meant it",

The habit only emerges once Julio begins craving the juice when he sees the cue. Once that craving exists, Julio will act automatically. He’ll follow the habit: <br><br>",
                    "<br><br> JULIO’S HABIT LOOP <br><br> This is how new habits are created: by putting together a cue, a routine, and a reward, and then cultivating a craving that drives the loop.2.26 Take, for instance, smoking. When a smoker sees a cue—say, a pack of Marlboros—her brain starts anticipating a hit of nicotine. Just the sight of cigarettes is enough for the brain to crave a nicotine rush. If it doesn’t arrive, the craving grows until the smoker reaches, unthinkingly, for a Marlboro.",
                    "<br><br>  <br><br> Or take email. When a computer chimes or a smartphone vibrates with a new message, the brain starts anticipating the momentary distraction that opening an email provides. That expectation, if unsatisfied, can build until a meeting is filled with antsy executives checking their buzzing BlackBerrys under the table, even if they know it’s probably only their latest fantasy football results. (On the other hand, if someone disables the buzzing—and, thus,",

As the next chapter explains, there are mechanisms that can help us ignore the temptations. But to overpower the habit, we must recognize which craving is driving the behavior.

But countless studies have shown that a cue and a reward, on their own, aren’t enough for a new habit to last. Only when your brain starts",

It’s a",

When they were young, he would pick at their dinners unthinkingly. “In some ways,” he told me, “we’re like the monkeys. When we see the chicken or fries on the table, our brains begin anticipating that food, even if we’re not hungry. Our brains are craving them. Frankly, I don’t even like this kind of food, but suddenly, it’s hard to fight this urge. And as soon as I eat it, I feel this rush of pleasure as",

I work hard because I expect pride from a discovery. I exercise because I expect feeling good afterward. I just wish I could pick and choose better.” <br><br> IV. <br><br> After their disastrous interview with the cat woman, Drake Stimson’s team at P&G started looking",

The house didn’t seem like the kind of place with smelly problems. There weren’t any pets. No one smoked. “How? What smells are you trying to get rid of?” <br><br> “I don’t really use it for specific smells,” the woman said. “I mean, you know, I’ve got boys. They’re going through puberty, and if I don’t clean their rooms, it smells like a locker. But I don’t really use it",

It’s a nice way to make everything smell good as a final touch.” <br><br> They asked if they could watch her clean the house. In the bedroom, she made her bed, plumped the pillows, tightened the sheet’s corners, and then took a Febreze bottle and sprayed the smoothed comforter. In the living room, she vacuumed, picked up the kids’ shoes, straightened the coffee table, and sprayed Febreze on the freshly cleaned carpet. “It’s nice, you know?” she said. “Spraying",

When the researchers got back to Cincinnati, some of them spent an evening looking through the tapes.

What if Febreze was something that happened at the end of the cleaning routine, rather than the beginning? What if it was the fun part of making something cleaner?” <br><br> Stimson’s team ran one more test. Previously, the product’s advertising had focused on",

Instead of eliminating scents on dirty fabrics, it became an air freshener used as the finishing touch, once things are already clean. <br><br> When the researchers went back",

They focused on the craving for that reward when temptations arose, cultivated the craving into a mild obsession. And their cravings for that reward, researchers found, crowded out the temptation to drop the diet. The craving drove the habit loop.2.33 <br><br>     For companies, understanding the science of cravings is revolutionary. There are dozens of daily rituals we",

We should take vitamins and apply sunscreen. The facts could not be more clear on this last front: Dabbing a bit of sunscreen on your face each morning significantly lowers the odds of skin cancer. Yet, while everyone brushes their teeth, fewer than 10 percent of Americans apply sunscreen each day.2.34 Why? <br><br> Because there’s no craving that has made sunscreen into a daily",

He’d been to detox and had taken pills. He’d made promises to his wife and joined abstinence groups. None of it worked. How, Wilson asked, had his friend done it? <br><br> “I got religion,” the friend said. He talked about hell and temptation, sin and the devil. “Realize you are",

When his friend left, Wilson polished off the booze and went to bed. <br><br> A month later, in December 1934, Wilson checked into the Charles B.

As scientists have begun understanding how AA works, they’ve started applying the program’s methods to other habits, such as two-year-olds’ tantrums, sex addictions, and even minor behavioral tics.

Lots of people bite their nails. For chronic nail biters, however, it’s a problem of a different scale. Mandy would often bite until her nails pulled away from the skin underneath. Her fingertips were covered with tiny scabs. The end of her fingers had become blunted without nails to protect them and",
                    "sometimes they tingled or itched, a sign of nerve injury. The biting habit had damaged her social life. She was so embarrassed around her friends that she kept her hands in her pockets and, on dates, would become preoccupied with balling her fingers into fists. She had tried to stop by painting her nails with foul-tasting polishes or promising herself, starting right now, that she would muster the willpower to quit. But as soon as she began doing homework or watching television, her fingers ended up in her mouth. <br><br> The counseling center referred Mandy to a doctoral psychology",
                    "student who was studying a treatment known as “habit reversal training.”3.24 The psychologist was well acquainted with the Golden Rule of habit change. He knew that changing Mandy’s nail biting habit required inserting a new routine into her life. <br><br> “What do you feel right before you bring your hand up to your mouth to bite your nails?” he asked her. <br><br> “There’s a little bit of tension in my fingers,” Mandy said. “It hurts a little bit here, at the edge of the nail. Sometimes I’ll run my thumb along, looking for hangnails, and",
                    "when I feel something catch, I’ll bring it up to my mouth. Then I’ll go finger by finger, biting all the rough edges. Once I start, it feels like I have to do all of them.” <br><br> Asking patients to describe what triggers their habitual behavior is called awareness training, and like AA’s insistence on forcing alcoholics to recognize their cues, it’s the first step in habit reversal training. The tension that Mandy felt in her nails cued her nail biting habit. <br><br> “Most people’s habits have occurred for so long they don’t pay",

At first, she had trouble coming up with reasons. As they talked, though, it became clear that she bit when she was bored. The therapist put her in some typical situations, such as watching television and doing homework,",
                    "and she started nibbling. When she had worked through all of the nails, she felt a brief sense of completeness, she said.

She knew how many times it occurred during class or while watching television. <br><br> Then the therapist taught Mandy what is known as a “competing response.” Whenever she felt that tension in her fingertips, he told her, she should immediately put her hands in her pockets or under her legs, or grip a pencil or something else that made it impossible to put her fingers in her mouth. Then Mandy was to search for something that would provide a",

It was months before the season started and everyone was sitting in the locker room.

The city didn’t care. Key players were injured. They didn’t have the",

He didn’t believe the Buccaneers needed the thickest playbook. He didn’t think they had to memorize hundreds of formations. They just had to learn a few key moves and get them right every time. <br><br> However, perfection is hard to",

What Dungy wanted was to take all that decision making out of their game. <br><br> And to do that, he needed them to recognize their existing habits and accept new routines. <br><br> He started by watching how his team already played.",
                    "<br><br> “Let’s work on the Under Defense,” Dungy shouted at a morning practice one day. “Number fifty-five, what’s your read?” <br><br> “I’m watching the running back and guard,” said Derrick Brooks, an outside linebacker. <br><br> “What precisely are you looking at? Where are your eyes?” <br><br> “I’m looking at the movement of the guard,” said Brooks. “I’m watching the QB’s legs and hips after he gets the ball. And I’m",

Dungy’s innovation was to use these keys as cues for reworked habits. He knew that, sometimes, Brooks hesitated a moment too long at the start of a play. There were so many things for him to think about—is the guard stepping out of formation? Does the running back’s foot indicate he’s preparing for a running or passing play?—that sometimes he slowed down.",
                    "<br><br> Dungy’s goal was to free Brooks’s mind from all that analysis. Like Alcoholics Anonymous, he used the same cues that Brooks was already accustomed to, but gave him different routines that, eventually, occurred automatically. <br><br> “I want you to use those same keys,” Dungy told Brooks. “But at first, focus only on the running back. That’s it. Do it without thinking. Once you’re in position, then start looking for the QB.” <br><br> This was a relatively modest",

The brilliance of this system was that it removed the need for decision making. It allowed Brooks to move faster, because everything was a reaction—and eventually a habit—rather than a choice. <br><br> Dungy gave every player similar instructions, and practiced the formations over and over.

                    "of the night. His wife answered and handed him the receiver, thinking it was one of his players. There was a nurse on the line. Dungy’s son Jamie had been brought into the hospital earlier in the evening, she said, with compression injuries on his throat. His girlfriend had found him hanging in his apartment, a belt around his neck. Paramedics had rushed him to the hospital, but efforts at revival were unsuccessful.3.34 He was gone. <br><br> A chaplain flew to spend Christmas with the family. “Life will never be the same again,” the chaplain told them, “but you won’t always feel",
                    "like you do right now.” <br><br> A few days after the funeral, Dungy returned to the sidelines. He needed something to distract himself, and his wife and team encouraged him to go back to work. “I was overwhelmed by their love and support,” he later wrote. “As a group, we had always leaned on each other in difficult times; I needed them now more than ever.” <br><br> The team lost their first play-off game, concluding their season. But in the aftermath of watching Dungy during this tragedy, “something changed,” one of his players from",

Dungy has always said that nothing is more important to him than his family. But in the wake of Jamie’s passing, as the Colts started preparing for the next season, something shifted, his players say. The team gave in to Dungy’s vision of how football should be played in a way they hadn’t before. They started to",

I kind of gave myself to the team.” <br><br> “Some men like hugging each other,” another player told me. “I don’t. I haven’t hugged my sons in a decade. But after Coach came back, I walked over and I hugged",

A conviction emerged among players about the strength of Dungy’s strategy. In practices and scrimmages leading up to the start of the 2006 season, the Colts played tight, precise football. <br><br> “Most football teams aren’t really teams. They’re just guys who work together,” a third player from that period told me. “But we became a team. It felt amazing. Coach was",
                    "the spark, but it was about more than him. After he came back, it felt like we really believed in each other, like we knew how to play together in a way we didn’t before.” <br><br> For the Colts, a belief in their team—in Dungy’s tactics and their ability to win—began to emerge out of tragedy.

Many of the people in the audience had invested millions of dollars in Alcoa stock and had enjoyed a steady return. In the past year, however, investor grumblings started.",
                    "Alcoa’s management had made misstep after misstep, unwisely trying to expand into new product lines while competitors stole customers and profits away. <br><br> So there had been a palpable sense of relief when Alcoa’s board announced it was time for new leadership. That relief, though, turned to unease when the choice was announced: the new CEO would be a former government bureaucrat named Paul O’Neill. Many on Wall Street had never heard of him. When Alcoa scheduled this meet and greet at the Manhattan ballroom, every",

He was fifty-one years old, trim, and dressed in gray pinstripes and a red power tie. His hair was white and his posture military straight. He bounced up the steps and smiled warmly. He looked dignified, solid, confident. Like a chief executive. <br><br> Then he opened his mouth. <br><br> “I want to talk to you about worker safety,” he said. “Every year, numerous Alcoa workers are",

Our safety record is better than the general American workforce, especially considering that our employees work with metals that are 1500 degrees and machines that can rip a man’s arm off. But it’s not good enough. I intend to make Alcoa the safest company in America. I intend to go for zero injuries.” <br><br> The audience was confused.

Next would come an excoriation of taxes, business regulations, and sometimes, with a fervor that suggested firsthand experience in divorce court, lawyers.

He didn’t mention taxes. There was no talk of “using",

Or, worse, a Democrat. It was a terrifying prospect. <br><br> “Now, before I go any further,” O’Neill said, “I want to point out the safety exits in this room.” He gestured to the rear of the ballroom. “There’s a couple of doors in the back, and in the unlikely event of a fire or other emergency, you should calmly walk out, go down the stairs to the lobby, and leave the building.”",

It will be because the individuals at this company have agreed to become part of something important: They’ve devoted themselves to creating a habit of excellence. Safety will be an indicator that we’re making progress in changing our habits across the entire institution. That’s how we should be judged.” <br><br> The investors in the room almost",

                    "<br><br> “I’m really glad to be here,” O’Neill told a room full of workers at a smelting plant in Tennessee a few months after he was hired. Not everything had gone smoothly. Wall Street was still panicked. The unions were concerned. Some of Alcoa’s vice presidents were miffed at being passed over for the top job. And O’Neill kept talking about worker safety. <br><br> “I’m happy to negotiate with you about anything,” O’Neill said. He was on a tour of Alcoa’s American plants, after which he was going to",
                    "visit the company’s facilities in thirty-one other countries. “But there’s one thing I’m never going to negotiate with you, and that’s safety. I don’t ever want you to say that we haven’t taken every step to make sure people don’t get hurt. If you want to argue with me about that, you’re going to lose.” <br><br> The brilliance of this approach was that no one, of course, wanted to argue with O’Neill about worker safety. Unions had been fighting for better safety rules for years. Managers didn’t want to argue about it, either, since injuries meant lost productivity and low morale.",
                    "<br><br> What most people didn’t realize, however, was that O’Neill’s plan for getting to zero injuries entailed the most radical realignment in Alcoa’s history. The key to protecting Alcoa employees, O’Neill believed, was understanding why injuries happened in the first place. And to understand why injuries happened, you had to study how the manufacturing process was going wrong. To understand how things were going wrong, you had to bring in people who could educate workers about quality control and the most efficient work processes,",
                    "so that it would be easier to do everything right, since correct work is also safer work. <br><br> In other words, to protect workers, Alcoa needed to become the best, most streamlined aluminum company on earth. <br><br> O’Neill’s safety plan, in effect, was modeled on the habit loop. He identified a simple cue: an employee injury. He instituted an automatic routine: Any time someone was injured, the unit president had to report it to O’Neill within twenty-four hours and present a plan for making sure the",

To contact O’Neill within twenty-four hours of an injury, they needed to hear about an accident from their vice presidents as soon as it happened. So vice presidents needed to be in constant communication with floor managers. And floor managers needed to get workers to raise warnings as soon as they saw a problem and keep a list of",

To make all of that happen, each unit had to build new communication systems that made it easier for the lowliest worker to get an idea to the loftiest executive, as fast as possible. Almost everything about the company’s rigid hierarchy had to change to accommodate O’Neill’s safety program. He was building new corporate habits. <br><br>      <br><br> ALCOA’S INSTITUTIONAL HABIT LOOP",
                    "<br><br> As Alcoa’s safety patterns shifted, other aspects of the company started changing with startling speed, as well. Rules that unions had spent decades opposing—such as measuring the productivity of individual workers—were suddenly embraced, because such measurements helped everyone figure out when part of the manufacturing process was getting out of whack, posing a safety risk. Policies that managers had long resisted—such as giving workers autonomy to shut down a production line when the pace",
                    "became overwhelming—were now welcomed, because that was the best way to stop injuries before they occurred. The company shifted so much that some employees found safety habits spilling into other parts of their lives. <br><br> “Two or three years ago, I’m in my office, looking at the Ninth Street bridge out the window, and there’s some guys working who aren’t using correct safety procedures,” said Jeff Shockey, Alcoa’s current safety director. One of them was standing on top of the bridge’s guardrail, while the other held on to",
                    "his belt. They weren’t using safety harnesses or ropes. “They worked for some company that has nothing to do with us, but without thinking about it, I got out of my chair, went down five flights of stairs, walked over the bridge and told these guys, hey, you’re risking your life, you have to use your harness and safety gear.” The men explained their supervisor had forgotten to bring the equipment. So Shockey called the local Occupational Safety and Health Administration office and turned the supervisor in. <br><br> “Another executive told me that",
                    "one day, he stopped at a street excavation near his house because they didn’t have a trench box, and gave everyone a lecture on the importance of proper procedures. It was the weekend, and he stopped his car, with his kids in the back, to lecture city workers about trench safety. That isn’t natural, but that’s kind of the point. We do this stuff without thinking about it now.” <br><br> O’Neill never promised that his focus on worker safety would increase Alcoa’s profits. However, as his new routines moved through the organization, costs came down, quality went up, and productivity",

It also saved money because Alcoa lost less raw materials in spills. If a machine kept breaking down, it was replaced, which meant there was less risk of a broken gear snagging an employee’s arm. It also meant higher quality products because, as Alcoa discovered, equipment malfunctions were a chief cause of subpar aluminum. <br><br> Researchers have found similar dynamics in dozens of other",

At eight-thirty, he slipped into the pool and began his first warm-up lap, 800 meters of mixed styles, followed by 600 meters of kicking, 400 meters pulling a buoy between his legs, 200 meters of stroke drills, and a series of 25-meter sprints to elevate his heart rate.

Bowman could also see that Phelps, even at a young age, had a capacity for obsessiveness that made him an ideal athlete. Then again, all elite performers are obsessives. <br><br> What Bowman could give Phelps, however—what would set him apart from other competitors—were habits that would make him the strongest mental swimmer in",

All he needed to do was target a few specific habits that had nothing to do with swimming and everything to do with creating the right mind-set. He designed a series of behaviors that Phelps could use to become calm and focused before each race, to find those tiny advantages that, in a sport where victory can come in milliseconds, would make all the difference. <br><br> When Phelps was a teenager, for instance, at the end of each practice, Bowman would tell him to go home and “watch the",

He would visualize his strokes, the walls of the pool, his turns, and the finish. He would imagine the wake behind his body, the water dripping off his lips as his mouth cleared the surface, what it would feel like to rip off his cap at the end. He would lie in bed",

It almost felt anticlimactic as he cut through the water. He had done this so many times in his head that, by now, it felt rote. But it worked. He got faster and faster. Eventually, all Bowman had to do before a race was whisper, “Get the videotape ready,” and Phelps would settle",

Others started using their journals to plan future menus, and when dinner rolled around, they ate the healthy meal they had written down, rather than junk food from the fridge. <br><br> The researchers hadn’t suggested any of these behaviors. They had simply asked everyone to write down what they ate once a week. But this keystone habit—food journaling—created a structure that helped other habits to flourish. Six months into the study, people",

It gave me a system for thinking about food without becoming depressed.” <br><br> Something similar happened at Alcoa after O’Neill took over. Just as food journals provided a structure for other habits to flourish, O’Neill’s safety habits created an atmosphere in which other behaviors emerged. Early on,",
                    "O’Neill took the unusual step of ordering Alcoa’s offices around the world to link up in an electronic network. This was in the early 1980s, when large, international networks weren’t usually connected to people’s desktop computers. O’Neill justified his order by arguing that it was essential to create a real-time safety data system that managers could use to share suggestions. As a result, Alcoa developed one of the first genuinely worldwide corporate email systems. <br><br> O’Neill logged on every morning and sent messages to make sure",
                    "everyone else was logged on as well. At first, people used the network primarily to discuss safety issues. Then, as email habits became more ingrained and comfortable, they started posting information on all kinds of other topics, such as local market conditions, sales quotas, and business problems. High-ranking executives were required to send in a report every Friday, which anyone in the company could read. A manager in Brazil used the network to send a colleague in New York data on changes in the price of steel. The New Yorker took that information and turned a quick",

Pretty soon, everyone was using the system to communicate about everything. “I would send in my accident report, and I knew everyone else read it, so I figured, why not send pricing information, or intelligence on other companies?” one manager told me. “It was like we had discovered a secret weapon. The competition couldn’t figure out how we were doing it.” <br><br> When the Web blossomed, Alcoa was perfectly positioned to take advantage. O’Neill’s keystone habit—worker safety—had created a",

His leadership had been studied by the Harvard Business School and the Kennedy School of Government. He was regularly mentioned as a potential commerce secretary or secretary of defense. His employees and the unions gave him high marks. Under his watch, Alcoa’s stock price had risen more than 200 percent. He was, at last, a",
                    "universally acknowledged success. <br><br> In May of that year, at a shareholder meeting in downtown Pittsburgh, a Benedictine nun stood up during the question-and-answer session and accused O’Neill of lying. Sister Mary Margaret represented a social advocacy group concerned about wages and conditions inside an Alcoa plant in Ciudad Acuña, Mexico. She said that while O’Neill extolled Alcoa’s safety measures, workers in Mexico were becoming sick because of dangerous fumes. <br><br> “It’s untrue,” O’Neill told the room.",
                    "On his laptop, he pulled up the safety records from the Mexican plant. “See?” he said, showing the room its high scores on safety, environmental compliance, and employee satisfaction surveys. The executive in charge of the facility, Robert Barton, was one of Alcoa’s most senior managers. He had been with the company for decades and was responsible for some of their largest partnerships. The nun said that the audience shouldn’t trust O’Neill. She sat down. <br><br> After the meeting, O’Neill asked her to come to his office. The nun’s",
                    "religious order owned fifty Alcoa shares, and for months they had been asking for a shareholder vote on a resolution to review the company’s Mexican operations. O’Neill asked Sister Mary if she had been to any of the plants herself. No, she told him. To be safe, O’Neill asked the company’s head of human resources and general counsel to fly to Mexico to see what was going on. <br><br> When the executives arrived, they poked through the Acuña plant’s records, and found reports of an incident that had never been sent to headquarters. A few months",
                    "earlier, there had been a buildup of fumes within a building. It was a relatively minor event. The plant’s executive, Barton, had installed ventilators to remove the gases. The people who had become ill had fully recovered within a day or two. <br><br> But Barton had never reported the illnesses. <br><br> When the executives returned to Pittsburgh and presented their findings, O’Neill had a question. <br><br> “Did Bob Barton know that people had gotten sick?” <br><br>",
                    "“We didn’t meet with him,” they answered. “But, yeah, it’s pretty clear he knew.” <br><br> Two days later, Barton was fired. <br><br> The exit shocked outsiders. Barton had been mentioned in articles as one of the company’s most valuable executives. His departure was a blow to important joint ventures. <br><br> Within Alcoa, however, no one was surprised. It was seen as an inevitable extension of the culture that O’Neill had built. <br><br>",
                    "“Barton fired himself,” one of his colleagues told me. “There wasn’t even a choice there.” <br><br> This is the final way that keystone habits encourage widespread change: by creating cultures where new values become ingrained. Keystone habits make tough choices—such as firing a top executive—easier, because when that person violates the culture, it’s clear they have to go. Sometimes these cultures manifest themselves in special vocabularies, the use of which becomes, itself, a habit that defines an organization. At Alcoa, for instance, there were “Core",
                    "Programs” and “Safety Philosophies,” phrases that acted like suitcases, containing whole conversations about priorities, goals, and ways of thinking. <br><br> “It might have been hard at another company to fire someone who had been there so long,” O’Neill told me. “It wasn’t hard for me. It was clear what our values dictated. He got fired because he didn’t report the incident, and so no one else had the opportunity to learn from it. Not sharing an opportunity to learn is a cardinal sin.” <br><br>",
                    "Cultures grow out of the keystone habits in every organization, whether leaders are aware of them or not. For instance, when researchers studied an incoming class of cadets at West Point, they measured their grade point averages, physical aptitude, military abilities, and self-discipline. When they correlated those factors with whether students dropped out or graduated, however, they found that all of them mattered less than a factor researchers referred to as “grit,” which they defined as the tendency to work “strenuously toward challenges, maintaining",
                    "effort and interest over years despite failure, adversity, and plateaus in progress.”4.26, 4.27 <br><br> What’s most interesting about grit is how it emerges. It grows out of a culture that cadets create for themselves, and that culture often emerges because of keystone habits they adopt at West Point. “There’s so much about this school that’s hard,” one cadet told me. “They call the first summer ‘Beast Barracks,’ because they want to grind you down. Tons of people quit before the school year starts. <br><br> “But I found this group of guys in",

I go to them if I’m feeling worried or down, and I know they’ll pump me back up. There’s only nine of us, and we call ourselves the musketeers. Without them, I don’t think I would have lasted a month here.” <br><br> Cadets who are successful at West Point arrive at the school armed with habits of mental and physical discipline. Those assets, however, only carry you so far. To succeed, they need a keystone habit that",
                    "creates a culture—such as a daily gathering of like-minded friends—to help find the strength to overcome obstacles. Keystone habits transform us by creating cultures that make clear the values that, in the heat of a difficult decision or a moment of uncertainty, we might otherwise forget. <br><br>  <br><br> In 2000, O’Neill retired from Alcoa, and at the request of the newly elected president George W. Bush, became secretary of the treasury.1 He left that post two years later,",
                    "and today spends most of his time teaching hospitals how to focus on worker safety and keystone habits that can lower medical error rates, as well as serving on various corporate boards. <br><br> Companies and organizations across America, in the meantime, have embraced the idea of using keystone habits to remake workplaces. At IBM, for instance, Lou Gerstner rebuilt the firm by initially concentrating on one keystone habit: IBM’s research and selling routines. At the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, a culture of continuous improvement",
                    "is created through a keystone habit of wide-ranging internal critiques that are at the core of every assignment. Within Goldman Sachs, a keystone habit of risk assessment undergirds every decision. <br><br> And at Alcoa, O’Neill’s legacy lives on. Even in his absence, the injury rate has continued to decline.

Pretty soon, everyone was getting to work earlier each day.” <br><br>  <br><br> 1 O’Neill’s tenure at Treasury was not as successful as his career at Alcoa. Almost immediately after taking office he began focusing on a couple of key issues, including worker safety, job creation, executive accountability, and fighting African poverty, among other initiatives. <br><br>",
                    "However, O’Neill’s politics did not line up with those of President Bush, and he launched an internal fight opposing Bush’s proposed tax cuts. He was asked to resign at the end of 2002. “What I thought was the right thing for economic policy was the opposite of what the White House wanted,” O’Neill told me. “That’s not good for a treasury secretary, so I got fired.”"

To Muraven, this model of willpower-as-skill wasn’t a satisfying explanation. A skill, after all, is something that remains constant from day to day. If you have the skill to make an omelet on Wednesday, you’ll still know how to make it on Friday. <br><br>",

Other days, he couldn’t do anything besides lie on the couch and watch television. It was as if his brain—or, at least, that part of his brain responsible for making him exercise—had forgotten how to summon the willpower to push him out the door. Some days, he ate healthily. Other days, when he was tired, he raided the vending machines and stuffed himself with candy and chips. <br><br>",

When the researcher asked afterward how they felt, one of the radish eaters said he was “sick of this dumb experiment.” <br><br> “By making people use a little bit of their willpower to ignore cookies, we had put them into a state where they were willing to quit much faster,” Muraven told me. “There’s been more than two hundred studies on this idea since then, and they’ve all found the same thing.

Some have suggested it helps clarify why otherwise successful people succumb to extramarital affairs (which are most likely to start late at night after a long day of using willpower at work) or why good physicians make dumb mistakes (which most often occur after a doctor has finished a long, complicated task that requires intense focus).5.5 “If you want to do something that requires",

Will exercising willpower muscles make them stronger the same way using dumbbells strengthen biceps? <br><br>",
                    "In 2006, two Australian researchers—Megan Oaten and Ken Cheng—tried to answer that question by creating a willpower workout. They enrolled two dozen people between the ages of eighteen and fifty in a physical exercise program and, over two months, put them through an increasing number of weight lifting, resistance training, and aerobic routines.5.7 Week after week, people forced themselves to exercise more frequently, using more and more willpower each time they hit the gym. <br><br> After two months, the researchers scrutinized the rest of the",

Before the experiment began, most of the subjects were self-professed couch potatoes. Now, of course, they were in better physical shape. But they were also healthier in other parts of their lives, as well. The more time they spent at the gym, the fewer cigarettes they smoked and the less alcohol, caffeine, and junk food they consumed. They were spending more hours on homework and fewer watching TV. They were less depressed. <br><br>",
                    "Maybe, Oaten and Cheng wondered, those results had nothing to do with willpower. What if exercise just makes people happier and less hungry for fast food? <br><br> So they designed another experiment.5.8 This time, they signed up twenty-nine people for a four-month money management program. They set savings goals and asked participants to deny themselves luxuries, such as meals at restaurants or movies.

A nurse brusquely told him he’d have to come back tomorrow; visiting hours were over. <br><br> Travis has thought a lot about that moment since then. He hadn’t started working at Starbucks yet. He hadn’t learned how to control his emotions. He didn’t have the habits that, since then, he’s spent years practicing. When he thinks about his life now, how far he is from a world where overdoses",

By then, he would have known how to calmly plead with the nurse. He would have known to acknowledge her authority, and then ask politely for one small exception. He could have gotten inside the hospital. Instead, he gave up and walked away. “I said, ‘All I want to do is talk",

Afterward, he had trouble staying awake and answering questions, and so eventually his wife called an ambulance.6.1 In the emergency room, a doctor asked him what happened, but the man kept nodding off in the middle of his sentences. A scan of his head revealed why: The fall had slammed his brain against his skull, causing what’s known as a subdural hematoma. Blood was",

More than three hundred of them stood outside the hospital with signs reading “Stop Slavery” and “They can’t take away our pride.”6.4 <br><br> “This place can be awful,” one nurse recalled telling a reporter. “The doctors can make you feel like you’re worthless, like you’re disposable. Like you should be thankful to pick up after them.” <br><br> Administrators eventually agreed to limit nurses’ mandatory overtime, but tensions continued to rise.6.5 A few years later, a surgeon",
                    "was preparing for a routine abdominal operation when a nurse called for a “time-out.” Such pauses are standard procedure at most hospitals, a way for doctors and staff to make sure mistakes are avoided.6.6 The nursing staff at Rhode Island Hospital was insistent on time-outs, particularly since a surgeon had accidentally removed the tonsils of a girl who was supposed to have eye surgery. Time-outs were supposed to catch such errors before they occurred. <br><br> At the abdominal surgery, when the OR nurse asked the team to gather around the patient for a",
                    "time-out and to discuss their plan, the doctor headed for the doors. <br><br> “Why don’t you lead this?” the surgeon told the nurse. “I’m going to step outside for a call. Knock when you’re ready.” <br><br> “You’re supposed to be here for this, Doctor,” she replied. <br><br> “You can handle it,” the surgeon said, as he walked toward the door. <br><br> “Doctor, I don’t feel this is appropriate.” <br><br> The doctor stopped and looked at",
                    "her. “If I want your damn opinion, I’ll ask for it,” he said. “Don’t ever question my authority again. If you can’t do your job, get the hell out of my OR.” <br><br> The nurse led the time-out, retrieved the doctor a few minutes later, and the procedure occurred without complication. She never contradicted a physician again, and never said anything when other safety policies were ignored. <br><br> “Some doctors were fine, and some were monsters,” one nurse who worked at Rhode Island Hospital in the mid-2000s told me. “We called",
                    "it the glass factory, because it felt like everything could crash down at any minute.” <br><br> To deal with these tensions, the staff had developed informal rules—habits unique to the institution—that helped avert the most obvious conflicts. Nurses, for instance, always double-checked the orders of error-prone physicians and quietly made sure that correct doses were entered; they took extra time to write clearly on patients’ charts, lest a hasty surgeon make the wrong cut. One nurse told me they developed a system of color codes to warn one another. “We",
                    "put doctors’ names in different colors on the whiteboards,” she said. “Blue meant ‘nice,’ red meant ‘jerk,’ and black meant, ‘whatever you do, don’t contradict them or they’ll take your head off.’ ” <br><br> Rhode Island Hospital was a place filled with a corrosive culture. Unlike at Alcoa, where carefully designed keystone habits surrounding worker safety had created larger and larger successes, inside Rhode Island Hospital, habits emerged on the fly among nurses seeking to offset physician arrogance. The hospital’s routines weren’t carefully thought out. Rather, they appeared",

For instance, when stations played “Breathe” by Blu Cantrell during the summer of 2003, almost no one changed the dial. The song is an eminently forgettable, beat-driven tune that DJs found so bland that most of them only played it reluctantly, they told music publications. But for some reason, whenever it came on the radio, people listened, even if, as pollsters later discovered, those same listeners said they didn’t like the song very much.

Yet whenever they came on the radio, almost no one changed the station. <br><br>     Then there were songs that listeners said they actively disliked, but were sticky nonetheless. Take Christina Aguilera or Celine Dion. In survey after survey, male listeners said they hated Celine Dion and couldn’t stand her songs. But whenever a Dion tune came on the radio, men stayed tuned in. Within",

However, they all seemed similar in that each sounded exactly like what Meyer expected to hear from that particular genre. They sounded familiar—like everything else on the radio—but a little more polished, a bit closer to the golden mean of the perfect song. <br><br> “Sometimes stations will do research by calling listeners on the phone, and play a snippet of a song, and listeners will say, ‘I’ve heard that a million times. I’m totally tired of it,’ ” Meyer told me.",

I can sing along!’ Sticky songs are what you expect to hear on the radio. Your brain secretly wants that song, because it’s so familiar to everything else you’ve already heard and liked. It just sounds right.” <br><br> There is evidence that a preference for things that sound “familiar” is a product of our neurology. Scientists have examined people’s brains as they listen to music, and have tracked which neural regions are involved in comprehending aural",

Listening to music activates numerous areas of the brain, including the auditory cortex, the thalamus, and the superior parietal cortex.7.19 These same areas are also associated with pattern recognition and helping the brain decide which inputs to pay attention to and which to ignore. The areas that process music, in other words, are designed to seek out patterns and look for familiarity. This makes sense. Music, after all, is complicated. The numerous tones, pitches, overlapping melodies, and competing sounds inside almost any song—or anyone speaking on",

Just as the scientists at MIT discovered that behavioral habits prevent us from becoming overwhelmed by the endless decisions we would otherwise have to make each day, listening habits exist because, without them, it",

Social habits are what fill streets with protesters who may not know one another, who might be marching for different reasons, but who are all moving in the same direction. Social habits are why some initiatives become world-changing movements, while others fail to ignite. And the reason why social habits have such influence is because at the root of many movements—be they large-scale revolutions or simple fluctuations in the churches people attend—is a three-part process that historians and sociologists say shows up again and again:8.4",
                    "<br><br> A movement starts because of the social habits of friendship and the strong ties between close acquaintances. <br><br> It grows because of the habits of a community, and the weak ties that hold neighborhoods and clans together. <br><br> And it endures because a movement’s leaders give participants new habits that create a fresh sense of identity and a feeling of ownership. <br><br>",
                    "Usually, only when all three parts of this process are fulfilled can a movement become self-propelling and reach a critical mass. There are other recipes for successful social change and hundreds of details that differ between eras and struggles. But understanding how social habits work helps explain why Montgomery and Rosa Parks became the catalyst for a civil rights crusade. <br><br> It wasn’t inevitable that Parks’s act of rebellion that winter day would result in anything other than her arrest. Then habits intervened, and something amazing occurred.",

In 1946, Geneva Johnson had been arrested for talking back to a Montgomery bus driver over seating.8.5 In 1949, Viola White, Katie Wingfield, and two black children were arrested for sitting in the white section and refusing to move.8.6 That same year, two black teenagers visiting from New Jersey—where buses were",

In 1955, just months before Parks was taken to jail, Claudette Colvin and Mary Louise Smith were arrested in separate incidents for refusing to give their seats to white passengers. <br><br> None of those arrests resulted in boycotts or protests, however. “There weren’t many real activists in Montgomery at the time,” Taylor Branch, the Pulitzer Prize–winning",

It wasn’t something average people did.” <br><br> When a young Martin Luther King, Jr., arrived in Montgomery in 1954, for instance, a year before Parks’s arrest, he found a majority of the city’s blacks accepted segregation “without apparent protest. Not only did they seem resigned to segregation per se; they also accepted the abuses and indignities which came with it.”8.8 <br><br> So why, when Parks was arrested,",
                    "did things change? <br><br> One explanation is that the political climate was shifting. The previous year, the U.S. Supreme Court had handed down Brown v. Board of Education, ruling that segregation was illegal within public schools; six months before Parks’s arrest, the Court had issued what came to be known as Brown II—a decision ordering that school integration must proceed with “all deliberate speed.” There was a powerful sense across the nation that change was in the air. <br><br> But that isn’t sufficient to explain",

Board, and yet they didn’t spark a protest. Brown, for many Montgomery residents, was an abstraction from a far-off courthouse, and it was unclear how—or if—its impact would be felt locally. Montgomery wasn’t Atlanta or Austin or other cities where progress seemed possible. “Montgomery was a pretty nasty place,” Branch said. “Racism was set in its ways there.” <br><br> When Parks was arrested, however,",

Rosa Parks, unlike other people who had been jailed for violating the bus segregation law, was deeply respected and embedded within her community. So when she was arrested, it triggered a series of social habits—the habits of friendship—that ignited an initial protest. Parks’s membership in dozens of social networks across Montgomery allowed her friends to muster a response before the community’s normal apathy could take hold. <br><br> Montgomery’s civil life, at the time, was dominated by hundreds of",
                    "small groups that created the city’s social fabric. The city’s Directory of Civil and Social Organizations was almost as thick as its phone book. Every adult, it seemed—particularly every black adult—belonged to some kind of club, church, social group, community center, or neighborhood organization, and often more than one. And within these social networks, Rosa Parks was particularly well known and liked. “Rosa Parks was one of those rare people of whom everyone agreed that she gave more than she got,” Branch wrote in his history of the civil rights movement, Parting the Waters. “Her character",
                    "represented one of the isolated high blips on the graph of human nature, offsetting a dozen or so sociopaths.”8.9 Parks’s many friendships and affiliations cut across the city’s racial and economic lines. She was the secretary of the local NAACP chapter, attended the Methodist church, and helped oversee a youth organization at the Lutheran church near her home. She spent some weekends volunteering at a shelter, others with a botanical club, and on Wednesday nights often joined a group of women who knit blankets for a local hospital. She volunteered dressmaking",

She had what sociologists call “strong ties”—firsthand relationships—with dozens of groups throughout Montgomery that didn’t usually come into contact with one another. “This was absolutely key,” Branch said. “Rosa Parks transcended the social stratifications of the black community and Montgomery as a whole. She was friends with field hands and college professors.”",

She was panicked, and her mother—who had no idea what to do—started going through a mental Rolodex of Parks’s friends, trying to think of someone who might be able to help. She called the wife of E. D. Nixon, the former head of the Montgomery NAACP, who in turn",

He immediately agreed to help, and called a prominent white lawyer named Clifford Durr who knew Parks because she had hemmed dresses for his three daughters. <br><br> Nixon and Durr went to the jailhouse, posted bail for Parks, and took her home. They’d been looking for the perfect case to challenge Montgomery’s bus segregation laws, and sensing an opportunity, they asked Parks if she would be willing to let them fight her arrest in court. Parks’s husband was",

She had been in Durr’s house and had helped his daughters prepare for cotillions. Her friends were now asking her for a favor. <br><br> “If you think it will mean something to Montgomery and do some good,” she told them, “I’ll be happy to go along with it.”8.11 <br><br> That night—just a few hours after the arrest—news of Parks’s jailing",

Jo Ann Robinson, the president of a powerful group of schoolteachers involved in politics and a friend of Parks’s from numerous organizations, heard about it. So did many of the schoolteachers in Robinson’s group, and many of the parents of their students. Close to midnight, Robinson called an impromptu meeting and suggested that everyone boycott the city’s buses on Monday, four days hence, when Parks was to appear in court. <br><br> Afterward, Robinson snuck into her office’s mimeograph room and",

In the months before the program started, newspapers and magazines were filled with articles predicting violence (which proved tragically accurate when, just a week after it began, white vigilantes killed three volunteers outside Longdale, Mississippi). The threat of harm kept many students from participating in the Mississippi Summer Project, even after they applied. More than a thousand",

Each was five pages long. Applicants were asked about their",

They were told to provide a list of people organizers should contact if they were arrested. There were essays, references, and, for some, interviews. Applying was not a casual undertaking. <br><br> McAdam’s initial hypothesis was that students who ended up going to Mississippi probably had different motivations from those who stayed home, which explained the divergence in participation. To test this idea, he divided applicants into two groups. The first pile were",

The other-oriented would be more",

The small groups gave them a chance to meet their neighbors. So, after he returned from his leave, Warren assigned every Saddleback member to a small group that met every week. It was one of the most important decisions he ever made, because it transformed church participation from a decision into a habit that drew on already-existing social urges and patterns. <br><br> “Now, when people come to",

You have this big crowd to remind you why you’re doing this in the first place, and a small group of close friends to help you focus on how to be faithful. Together, they’re like glue. We have over five thousand small groups now. It’s the only thing that makes a church this",

Otherwise, I’d work myself to death, and 95 percent of the congregation would never receive the attention they came here looking for.” <br><br> Without realizing it, Warren, in some ways, has replicated the structure that propelled the Montgomery bus boycott—though he has done it in reverse. That boycott started among people who knew Rosa Parks, and became a mass protest when the weak ties of the community compelled participation. At Saddleback Church, it works the other way around. People are attracted by a",

Then once inside, they’re pushed into a small group of neighbors—a petri dish, if you will, for growing close ties—where their faith becomes an aspect of their social experience and daily lives. <br><br> Creating small groups, however, isn’t enough. When Warren asked people what they discussed in one another’s living rooms, he discovered they talked about the Bible and prayed together for ten minutes, and then spent the rest of the time discussing kids or gossiping. Warren’s goal, however,",

It was to build a community of the faithful, to encourage people to accept the lessons of Christ, and to make faith a focus of their lives. His small groups had created tight bonds, but without leadership, they weren’t much more than a coffee circle. They weren’t fulfilling his religious expectations. <br><br> Warren thought back to McGavran, the author. McGavran’s philosophy said that if you teach people to live with Christian habits, they’ll act as Christians without requiring constant guidance and monitoring.",
                    "Warren couldn’t lead every single small group in person; he couldn’t be there to make sure every conversation focused on Christ instead of the latest TV shows. But if he gave people new habits, he figured, he wouldn’t need to. When people gathered, their instincts would be to discuss the Bible, to pray together, to embody their faith. <br><br> So Warren created a series of curriculums, used in church classes and small group discussions, which were explicitly designed to teach parishioners new habits. <br><br>",

Giving everyone new habits has",

These habits become a new self-identity, and, at that point, we just need to support you and get out of your way.”8.30 <br><br> Warren’s insight was that he could expand his church the same way Martin Luther King grew the boycott: by relying on the combination of strong and weak ties. Transforming his church into a",

She had lied to herself about so much already: that her marriage was happy when she and her husband sometimes went days without really speaking; that her friends were close when she knew they appeared for Vegas trips and were gone when it was over; that she was a good mom",

She didn’t tell her husband. “I concentrated on something new whenever that night popped into my mind,” she said. <br><br>",

Some nights, after her husband was asleep, Bachmann would crawl out of bed, sit at the kitchen table, and scribble out figures, trying to make sense of how much was gone. The depression that had started after her parents’ death seemed to be getting deeper. She felt so tired all the time. <br><br> And Harrah’s kept calling. <br><br> “This desperation starts once you realize how much you’ve lost, and then you feel like you can’t stop because you’ve got to win it back,”",

If you couldn’t win, then gambling wouldn’t be legal, right?” <br><br>  <br><br> In 2010, a cognitive neuroscientist named Reza Habib asked twenty-two people to lie inside an MRI and watch a slot machine spin around",

The slot machine was programmed to deliver three outcomes: a win, a loss, and a “near miss,” in which the slots almost matched up but, at the last",

People with gambling",

By then, her bank account was almost empty. When she tried to calculate how much she had lost over her lifetime, she put the figure at about $900,000. She had told Harrah’s that she was almost broke, but the man on the phone said to come anyway. They would give her a line of credit, he said. <br><br>",

She started playing $400 a hand, two hands at a time. If she could get up a little bit, she told herself, just $100,000, she could quit and have something to give her kids. Her husband joined her for a while, but at midnight he went to",

Six times she signed for more cash, for a total of $125,000. <br><br> At about six in the morning, she hit a hot streak and her piles of chips began to grow. A crowd gathered. She did a quick tally: not quite enough to pay off the notes she had signed, but if she kept playing smart, she would come out on top, and then quit for good. She won five times in a row. She only needed to win $20,000 more to pull ahead. Then the dealer hit 21. Then he hit it",

                    "Habib’s research on the brains of problem gamblers—was also driven by powerful cravings. She may have made a choice that first day when she got dressed up and decided to spend the afternoon in a casino, and perhaps in the weeks or months that followed. But years later, by the time she was losing $250,000 in a single night, after she was so desperate to fight the urges that she moved to a state where gambling wasn’t legal, she was no longer making conscious decisions. “Historically, in neuroscience, we’ve said that people with brain damage lose some of their free will,” said Habib. “But when a",
                    "pathological gambler sees a casino, it seems very similar. It seems like they’re acting without choice.”9.28 <br><br> Thomas’s lawyer argued, in a manner that everyone believed, that his client had made a terrible mistake and would carry the guilt of it for life. However, isn’t it clear that Bachmann feels much the same way? “I feel so guilty, so ashamed of what I’ve done,” she told me. “I feel like I’ve let everyone down. I know that I’ll never be able to make up for this, no matter what I do.” <br><br>",
                    "That said, there is one critical distinction between the cases of Thomas and Bachmann: Thomas murdered an innocent person. He committed what has always been the gravest of crimes. Angie Bachmann lost money. The only victims were herself, her family, and a $27 billion company that loaned her $125,000. <br><br> Thomas was set free by society. Bachmann was held accountable for her deeds. <br><br> Ten months after Bachmann lost everything, Harrah’s tried to collect from her bank. The promissory",

She countersued, claiming that by extending her credit, free suites, and booze, Harrah’s had preyed on someone they knew had no control over her habits. Her case went all the way to the state Supreme Court. Bachmann’s lawyer—echoing the arguments that Thomas’s attorney had made on the murderer’s behalf—said that she shouldn’t be held culpable because she had been reacting",

Once the offers started rolling in, he argued, once she walked into the casino, her habits took over and it was impossible for her to control her behavior. <br><br> The justices, acting on behalf of society, said Bachmann was wrong. “There is no common law duty obligating a casino operator to refrain from attempting to entice or contact gamblers that it knows or should know are compulsive gamblers,” the court wrote. The state had a “voluntary exclusion program” in which any person",
                    "could ask for their name to be placed upon a list that required casinos to bar them from playing, and “the existence of the voluntary exclusion program suggests the legislature intended pathological gamblers to take personal responsibility to prevent and protect themselves against compulsive gambling,” wrote Justice Robert Rucker. <br><br> Perhaps the difference in outcomes for Thomas and Bachmann is fair. After all, it’s easier to sympathize with a devastated widower than a housewife who threw everything away.",
                    "<br><br> Why is it easier, though? Why does it seem the bereaved husband is a victim, while the bankrupt gambler got her just deserts? Why do some habits seem like they should be so easy to control, while others seem out of reach? <br><br> More important, is it right to make a distinction in the first place? <br><br> “Some thinkers,” Aristotle wrote in Nicomachean Ethics, “hold that it is by nature that people become good, others that it is by habit, and others that it is by instruction.” For",
                    "Aristotle, habits reigned supreme. The behaviors that occur unthinkingly are the evidence of our truest selves, he said. So “just as a piece of land has to be prepared beforehand if it is to nourish the seed, so the mind of the pupil has to be prepared in its habits if it is to enjoy and dislike the right things.” <br><br> Habits are not as simple as they appear. As I’ve tried to demonstrate throughout this book, habits—even once they are rooted in our minds—aren’t destiny. We can choose our habits, once we know how. Everything we know",

The most dysfunctional companies can transform themselves. A high school dropout can become a successful manager. <br><br> However, to modify a habit, you must decide to change it. You must consciously accept the hard work of identifying the cues and rewards that drive the habits’ routines, and find alternatives. You must know you have control and be self-conscious enough to use it—and",
                    "every chapter in this book is devoted to illustrating a different aspect of why that control is real. <br><br> So though both Angie Bachmann and Brian Thomas made variations on the same claim—that they acted out of habit, that they had no control over their actions because those behaviors unfolded automatically—it seems fair that they should be treated differently. It is just that Angie Bachmann should be held accountable and that Brian Thomas should go free because Thomas never knew the patterns that drove him to kill existed in the first place—much less that he could",
                    "master them. Bachmann, on the other hand, was aware of her habits. And once you know a habit exists, you have the responsibility to change it. If she had tried a bit harder, perhaps she could have reined them in. Others have done so, even in the face of greater temptations. <br><br> That, in some ways, is the point of this book. Perhaps a sleepwalking murderer can plausibly argue he wasn’t aware of his habit, and so he doesn’t bear responsibility for his crime. But almost all the other patterns that exist in most people’s lives—how we eat and sleep and",
                    "talk to our kids, how we unthinkingly spend our time, attention, and money—those are habits that we know exist. And once you understand that habits can change, you have the freedom—and the responsibility—to remake them. Once you understand that habits can be rebuilt, the power of habit becomes easier to grasp, and the only option left is to get to work. <br><br>  <br><br> “All our life,” William James told us in the prologue, “so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits—practical, emotional, and",
                    "intellectual—systematically organized for our weal or woe, and bearing us irresistibly toward our destiny, whatever the latter may be.”9.29 <br><br> James, who died in 1910, hailed from an accomplished family. His father was a wealthy and prominent theologian. His brother, Henry, was a brilliant, successful writer whose novels are still studied today. William, into his thirties, was the unaccomplished one in the family. He was sick as a child. He wanted to become a painter, and then enrolled in medical school, then left to join an expedition up",
                    "the Amazon River. Then he quit that, as well. He chastised himself in his diary for not being good at anything. What’s more, he wasn’t certain if he could get better. In medical school, he had visited a hospital for the insane and had seen a man hurling himself against a wall. The patient, a doctor explained, suffered from hallucinations. James didn’t say that he often felt like he shared more in common with the patients than his fellow physicians. <br><br> “Today I about touched bottom, and perceive plainly that I must face the choice with open eyes,”",
                    "James wrote in his diary in 1870, when he was twenty-eight years old. “Shall I frankly throw the moral business overboard, as one unsuited to my innate aptitudes?” <br><br> Is suicide, in other words, a better choice? <br><br> Two months later, James made a decision. Before doing anything rash, he would conduct a yearlong experiment. He would spend twelve months believing that he had control over himself and his destiny, that he could become better, that he had the free will to change. There was no proof that it",
                    "was true. But he would free himself to believe, all evidence to the contrary, that change was possible. “I think that yesterday was a crisis in my life,” he wrote in his diary. Regarding his ability to change, “I will assume for the present—until next year—that it is no illusion. My first act of free will shall be to believe in free will.” <br><br>     Over the next year, he practiced every day. In his diary, he wrote as if his control over himself and his choices was never in question. He got married. He started teaching at Harvard. He began spending time with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who",
                    "would go on to become a Supreme Court justice, and Charles Sanders Peirce, a pioneer in the study of semiotics, in a discussion group they called the Metaphysical Club.9.30 Two years after writing his diary entry, James sent a letter to the philosopher Charles Renouvier, who had expounded at length on free will. “I must not lose this opportunity of telling you of the admiration and gratitude which have been excited in me by the reading of your Essais,” James wrote. “Thanks to you I possess for the first time an intelligible and reasonable conception of freedom.… I can say that through",
                    "that philosophy I am beginning to experience a rebirth of the moral life; and I can assure you, sir, that this is no small thing.” <br><br> Later, he would famously write that the will to believe is the most important ingredient in creating belief in change. And that one of the most important methods for creating that belief was habits. Habits, he noted, are what allow us to “do a thing with difficulty the first time, but soon do it more and more easily, and finally, with sufficient practice, do it semi-mechanically, or with hardly any consciousness at all.” Once we choose who we",
                    "want to be, people grow “to the way in which they have been exercised, just as a sheet of paper or a coat, once creased or folded, tends to fall forever afterward into the same identical folds.” <br><br> If you believe you can change—if you make it a habit—the change becomes real. This is the real power of habit: the insight that your habits are what you choose them to be. Once that choice occurs—and becomes automatic—it’s not only real, it starts to seem inevitable, the thing, as James wrote, that bears “us irresistibly toward our destiny, whatever the latter may be.”",
                    "<br><br> The way we habitually think of our surroundings and ourselves create the worlds that each of us inhabit. “There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says ‘Morning, boys. How’s the water?’ ” the writer David Foster Wallace told a class of graduating college students in 2005. “And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes ‘What the hell is water?’ ” <br><br>",
                    "The water is habits, the unthinking choices and invisible decisions that surround us every day—and which, just by looking at them, become visible again. <br><br>     Throughout his life, William James wrote about habits and their central role in creating happiness and success. He eventually devoted an entire chapter in his masterpiece The Principles of Psychology to the topic. Water, he said, is the most apt analogy for how a habit works. Water “hollows out for itself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and, after having ceased to flow, it",

In 1922, the psychiatrist Carl Jung chose this spot to begin building a retreat. He began with a basic two-story stone house he called the Tower. After returning from a trip to India, where he observed the practice of adding meditation rooms to homes, he expanded the complex to include a private office. “In my retiring room I am by myself,” Jung said of the space. “I keep the key with me all the time; no one else is allowed in",
                    "there except with my permission.” <br><br> In his book Daily Rituals, journalist Mason Currey sorted through various sources on Jung to re-create the psychiatrist’s work habits at the Tower. Jung would rise at seven a.m., Currey reports, and after a big breakfast he would spend two hours of undistracted writing time in his private office. His afternoons would often consist of meditation or long walks in the surrounding countryside. There was no electricity at the Tower, so as day gave way to night, light came from oil lamps and heat from the fireplace. Jung would retire to",

In 1922, when Jung bought the property, he could not afford to take a vacation. Only one year earlier, in 1921, he had published Psychological Types, a seminal book that solidified many differences that had been long",

The sixteenth-century essayist Michel de Montaigne, for example, prefigured Jung by working in a private library he built in the southern tower guarding the stone walls of his French château, while Mark Twain wrote much of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer in a shed on the property of the Quarry Farm in New York, where he was spending the summer. Twain’s study was so isolated from the main house that his family took to blowing a horn to attract his attention for meals. <br><br>",

The French economist Thomas Piketty made this point explicit in his study of the extreme growth of executive salaries. The enabling assumption driving his argument is that “it is objectively difficult to measure",

We learn that he works in a converted barn in Wisconsin farm country, not far inland from the scenic Sturgeon Bay of Lake Michigan. Furrer often leaves the barn doors open (to vent the heat of the forges, one suspects), his efforts framed by farm fields stretching to the horizon. The setting is idyllic but the work can seem, at first encounter, brutish. In the documentary, Furrer is trying to re-create a Viking-era",

This dense ingot must then be shaped and polished into a long and elegant sword blade. <br><br> “This part, the initial breakdown, is terrible,” Furrer says to the camera as he methodically heats the ingot, hits it with a hammer, turns it, hits it, then puts it back in the flames to start over.

After a moment of relief that the blade did not crack into pieces—a common occurrence at this step—Furrer pulls it from the oil. The",

During this brief pause, the flames illuminate his face, and his admiration is palpable. <br><br> “To do it right, it is the most complicated thing I know how to make,” Furrer explains. “And it’s that challenge that drives me.

These pagers would beep at randomly selected intervals (in modern incarnations of this method, smartphone apps play the same role). When the beeper went off, the subjects would record what they were doing at the exact moment and how they felt. In some cases, they would be provided with a journal in which to record this information while in others they would be given a phone number to call to answer questions posed by a field-worker. Because the beeps were only",
                    "occasional but hard to ignore, the subjects were likely to follow through with the experimental procedure. And because the subjects were recording responses about an activity at the very moment they were engaged in it, the responses were more accurate. Csikszentmihalyi and Larson called the approach the experience sampling method (ESM), and it provided unprecedented insight into how we actually feel about the beats of our daily lives. <br><br> Among many breakthroughs, Csikszentmihalyi’s work with ESM helped validate a theory he had",
                    "been developing over the preceding decade: “The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.” Csikszentmihalyi calls this mental state flow (a term he popularized with a 1990 book of the same title). At the time, this finding pushed back against conventional wisdom. Most people assumed (and still do) that relaxation makes them happy. We want to work less and spend more time in the hammock. But the results from Csikszentmihalyi’s ESM studies reveal that most people have this",
                    "wrong: <br><br>  <br><br> Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed. <br><br>",
                    "<br><br> When measured empirically, people were happier at work and less happy relaxing than they suspected. And as the ESM studies confirmed, the more such flow experiences that occur in a given week, the higher the subject’s life satisfaction. Human beings, it seems, are at their best when immersed deeply in something challenging. <br><br> There is, of course, overlap between the theory of flow and the ideas of Winifred Gallagher highlighted in the last section. Both point toward",

Gallagher’s writing emphasizes that the content of what we focus on matters. If we give rapt attention to important things, and therefore also ignore shallow negative things, we’ll experience our working life as more important and positive. Csikszentmihalyi’s theory of flow, by contrast, is mostly agnostic to the content of our attention. Though he would likely agree with the research cited by Gallagher, his theory notes that the feeling of going deep is in itself very",

Our minds like this challenge, regardless of the subject. <br><br>  <br><br> The connection between deep work and flow should be clear: Deep work is an activity well suited to generate a flow state (the phrases used by Csikszentmihalyi to describe what generates flow include notions of stretching your mind to its limits, concentrating, and losing yourself in an activity—all of which also describe deep work). And as we just learned, flow generates happiness. Combining",
                    "these two ideas we get a powerful argument from psychology in favor of depth. Decades of research stemming from Csikszentmihalyi’s original ESM experiments validate that the act of going deep orders the consciousness in a way that makes life worthwhile. Csikszentmihalyi even goes so far as to argue that modern companies should embrace this reality, suggesting that “jobs should be redesigned so that they resemble as closely as possible flow activities.” Noting, however, that such a redesign would be difficult and disruptive (see, for example, my arguments from the",
                    "previous chapter), Csikszentmihalyi then explains that it’s even more important that the individual learn how to seek out opportunities for flow. This, ultimately, is the lesson to come away with from our brief foray into the world of experimental psychology: To build your working life around the experience of flow produced by deep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction. <br><br> A Philosophical Argument for Depth <br><br> Our final argument for the connection between depth and meaning requires us to step back",
                    "from the more concrete worlds of neuroscience and psychology and instead adopt a philosophical perspective. I’ll turn for help in this discussion to a pair of scholars who know this topic well: Hubert Dreyfus, who taught philosophy at Berkeley for more than four decades, and Sean Dorrance Kelly, who at the time of this writing is the chair of Harvard’s philosophy department. In 2011, Dreyfus and Kelly published a book, All Things Shining, which explores how notions of sacredness and meaning have evolved throughout the history of human culture. They set out to reconstruct this history because they’re worried",
                    "about its endpoint in our current era. “The world used to be, in its various forms, a world of sacred, shining things,” Dreyfus and Kelly explain early in the book. “The shining things now seem far away.” <br><br> What happened between then and now? The short answer, the authors argue, is Descartes. From Descartes’s skepticism came the radical belief that the individual seeking certainty trumped a God or king bestowing truth. The resulting Enlightenment, of course, led to the concept of human rights and freed many from oppression. But as Dreyfus and Kelly emphasize, for all",
                    "its good in the political arena, in the domain of the metaphysical this thinking stripped the world of the order and sacredness essential to creating meaning. In a post-Enlightenment world we have tasked ourselves to identify what’s meaningful and what’s not, an exercise that can seem arbitrary and induce a creeping nihilism. “The Enlightenment’s metaphysical embrace of the autonomous individual leads not just to a boring life,” Dreyfus and Kelly worry; “it leads almost inevitably to a nearly unlivable one.” <br><br> This problem might at first seem",
                    "far removed from our quest to understand the satisfaction of depth, but when we proceed to Dreyfus and Kelly’s solution, we will discover rich new insights into the sources of meaning in professional pursuits. This connection should seem less surprising when it’s revealed that Dreyfus and Kelly’s response to modern nihilism builds on the very subject that opened this chapter: the craftsman. <br><br> Craftsmanship, Dreyfus and Kelly argue in their book’s conclusion, provides a key to reopening a sense of sacredness in a responsible manner. To illustrate",
                    "this claim, they use as an organizing example an account of a master wheelwright—the now lost profession of shaping wooden wagon wheels. “Because each piece of wood is distinct, it has its own personality,” they write after a passage describing the details of the wheelwright’s craft. “The woodworker has an intimate relationship with the wood he works. Its subtle virtues call out to be cultivated and cared for.” In this appreciation for the “subtle virtues” of his medium, they note, the craftsman has stumbled onto something crucial in a post-Enlightenment world: a source of",
                    "meaning sited outside the individual. The wheelwright doesn’t decide arbitrarily which virtues of the wood he works are valuable and which are not; this value is inherent in the wood and the task it’s meant to perform. <br><br> As Dreyfus and Kelly explain, such sacredness is common to craftsmanship. The task of a craftsman, they conclude, “is not to generate meaning, but rather to cultivate in himself the skill of discerning the meanings that are already there.” This frees the craftsman of the nihilism of autonomous individualism,",

The wheelwright, the authors imply, cannot easily use the inherent quality of a piece of pine to justify a despotic monarchy. <br><br>  <br><br> Returning to the question of professional satisfaction, Dreyfus and Kelly’s interpretation of craftsmanship as a path to meaning provides a nuanced understanding of why the work of those like Ric Furrer resonates with",
                    "so many of us. The look of satisfaction on Furrer’s face as he works to extract artistry from crude metals, these philosophers would argue, is a look expressing appreciation for something elusive and valuable in modernity: a glimpse of the sacred. <br><br> Once understood, we can connect this sacredness inherent in traditional craftsmanship to the world of knowledge work. To do so, there are two key observations we must first make. The first might be obvious but requires emphasis: There’s nothing intrinsic about the manual trades when it comes to",
                    "generating this particular source of meaning. Any pursuit—be it physical or cognitive—that supports high levels of skill can also generate a sense of sacredness. <br><br> To elaborate this point, let’s jump from the old-fashioned examples of carving wood or smithing metal to the modern example of computer programming. Consider this quote from the coding prodigy Santiago Gonzalez describing his work to an interviewer: <br><br>  <br><br>",
                    "Beautiful code is short and concise, so if you were to give that code to another programmer they would say, “oh, that’s well written code.” It’s much like as if you were writing a poem. <br><br>  <br><br> Gonzalez discusses computer programming similarly to the way woodworkers discuss their craft in the passages quoted by Dreyfus and Kelly. <br><br> The Pragmatic Programmer, a well-regarded book in the computer programming field,",
                    "makes this connection between code and old-style craftsmanship more directly by quoting the medieval quarry worker’s creed in its preface: “We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.” The book then elaborates that computer programmers must see their work in the same way: <br><br>  <br><br> Within the overall structure of a project there is always room for individuality and craftsmanship… One hundred years from now, our engineering may seem as archaic",
                    "as the techniques used by medieval cathedral builders seem to today’s civil engineers, while our craftsmanship will still be honored. <br><br>  <br><br> You don’t, in other words, need to be toiling in an open-air barn for your efforts to be considered the type of craftsmanship that can generate Dreyfus and Kelly’s meaning. A similar potential for craftsmanship can be found in most skilled jobs in the information economy. Whether you’re a writer, marketer, consultant, or lawyer: Your work is craft, and if you hone",
                    "your ability and apply it with respect and care, then like the skilled wheelwright you can generate meaning in the daily efforts of your professional life. <br><br> It’s here that some might respond that their knowledge work job cannot possibly become such a source of meaning because their job’s subject is much too mundane. But this is flawed thinking that our consideration of traditional craftsmanship can help correct. In our current culture, we place a lot of emphasis on job description. Our obsession with the advice to “follow your passion” (the subject of my",
                    "last book), for example, is motivated by the (flawed) idea that what matters most for your career satisfaction is the specifics of the job you choose. In this way of thinking, there are some rarified jobs that can be a source of satisfaction—perhaps working in a nonprofit or starting a software company—while all others are soulless and bland. The philosophy of Dreyfus and Kelly frees us from such traps. The craftsmen they cite don’t have rarified jobs. Throughout most of human history, to be a blacksmith or a wheelwright wasn’t glamorous. But this doesn’t matter, as the specifics of the work are",
                    "irrelevant. The meaning uncovered by such efforts is due to the skill and appreciation inherent in craftsmanship—not the outcomes of their work. Put another way, a wooden wheel is not noble, but its shaping can be. The same applies to knowledge work. You don’t need a rarified job; you need instead a rarified approach to your work. <br><br> The second key observation about this line of argument is that cultivating craftsmanship is necessarily a deep task and therefore requires a commitment to deep work. (Recall that I argued in Chapter 1 that deep work is",
                    "necessary to hone skills and to then apply them at an elite level—the core activities in craft.) Deep work, therefore, is key to extracting meaning from your profession in the manner described by Dreyfus and Kelly. It follows that to embrace deep work in your own career, and to direct it toward cultivating your skill, is an effort that can transform a knowledge work job from a distracted, draining obligation into something satisfying—a portal to a world full of shining, wondrous things. <br><br> Homo Sapiens Deepensis <br><br>",
                    "The first two chapters of Part 1 were pragmatic. They argued that deep work is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy at the same time that it also is becoming increasingly rare (for somewhat arbitrary reasons). This represents a classic market mismatch: If you cultivate this skill, you’ll thrive professionally. <br><br> This final chapter, by contrast, has little to add to this practical discussion of workplace advancement, and yet it’s absolutely necessary for these earlier ideas to gain traction. The pages ahead describe a rigorous",
                    "program for transforming your professional life into one centered on depth. This is a difficult transition, and as with many such efforts, well-reasoned, pragmatic arguments can motivate you only to a certain point. Eventually, the goal you pursue needs to resonate at a more human level. This chapter argues that when it comes to the embrace of depth, such resonance is inevitable. Whether you approach the activity of going deep from the perspective of neuroscience, psychology, or lofty philosophy, these paths all seem to lead back to a connection between depth and meaning. It’s as if our",

Dewane is an architecture professor, and therefore likes to explore the intersection between the conceptual and the concrete. The Eudaimonia Machine is a good example of this intersection. The machine, which takes its name from the ancient Greek concept of eudaimonia (a state in which you’re achieving your full human",
                    "potential), turns out to be a building. “The goal of the machine,” David explained, “is to create a setting where the users can get into a state of deep human flourishing—creating work that’s at the absolute extent of their personal abilities.” It is, in other words, a space designed for the sole purpose of enabling the deepest possible deep work. I was, as you might expect, intrigued. <br><br> As Dewane explained the machine to me, he grabbed a pen to sketch its proposed layout. The structure is a one-story narrow rectangle made up of five rooms, placed in a",
                    "line, one after another. There’s no shared hallway: you have to pass through one room to get to the next. As Dewane explains, “[The lack of circulation] is critical because it doesn’t allow you to bypass any of the spaces as you get deeper into the machine.” <br><br> The first room you enter when coming off the street is called the gallery. In Dewane’s plan, this room would contain examples of deep work produced in the building. It’s meant to inspire users of the machine, creating a “culture of healthy stress and peer pressure.” <br><br>",
                    "As you leave the gallery, you next enter the salon. In here, Dewane imagines access to high-quality coffee and perhaps even a full bar. There are also couches and Wi-Fi. The salon is designed to create a mood that “hovers between intense curiosity and argumentation.” This is a place to debate, “brood,” and in general work through the ideas that you’ll develop deeper in the machine. <br><br> Beyond the salon you enter the library. This room stores a permanent record of all work produced in the machine, as well as the books and other resources",
                    "used in this previous work. There will be copiers and scanners for gathering and collecting the information you need for your project. Dewane describes the library as “the hard drive of the machine.” <br><br> The next room is the office space. It contains a standard conference room with a whiteboard and some cubicles with desks. “The office,” Dewane explains, “is for low-intensity activity.” To use our terminology, this is the space to complete the shallow efforts required by your project. Dewane imagines an administrator with a",
                    "desk in the office who could help its users improve their work habits to optimize their efficiency. <br><br> This brings us to the final room of the machine, a collection of what Dewane calls “deep work chambers” (he adopted the term “deep work” from my articles on the topic). Each chamber is conceived to be six by ten feet and protected by thick soundproof walls (Dewane’s plans call for eighteen inches of insulation). “The purpose of the deep work chamber is to allow for total focus and uninterrupted work flow,” Dewane explains. He imagines a process in",
                    "which you spend ninety minutes inside, take a ninety-minute break, and repeat two or three times—at which point your brain will have achieved its limit of concentration for the day. <br><br> For now, the Eudaimonia Machine exists only as a collection of architectural drawings, but even as a plan, its potential to support impactful work excites Dewane. “[This design] remains, in my mind, the most interesting piece of architecture I’ve ever produced,” he told me. <br><br>",

As he explains on his website: “What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration.” A doctoral candidate named Brian Chappell, who is a father with a full-time job, also values deep work, as it’s the only way he can make progress on his dissertation given his limited time. Chappell told me that his first encounter with the idea of deep work was “an emotional moment.”",

As I’ll detail in the next section, Knuth deploys a form of monasticism that prioritizes deep work by trying to eliminate or minimize all other types of work. Chappell, by contrast, deploys a rhythmic strategy in which he works for the same hours (five to seven thirty a.m.) every weekday morning, without exception, before beginning a workday punctuated",

The goal is to convince you that there are many different ways to integrate deep work into your schedule, and it’s therefore worth taking the time to find an approach that makes sense for you. <br><br>",

I’d used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15 years of email is plenty for one lifetime. Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things.

Every day that he writes jokes he crosses out the date on the calendar with a big red X. “After a few days you’ll have a chain,” Seinfeld said. “Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day.

For example, if your goal is to increase customer satisfaction in your bakery, then the relevant lag measure is your customer satisfaction scores. As the 4DX authors explain, the problem with lag measures is that they come too late to change your behavior: “When you receive them,",

This is a number you can directly increase by giving out more samples. As you increase this number, your lag measures will likely eventually improve as well.

Why spend money to “buy in” feed when you have perfectly good grass growing for free right in your own soil?

                    "would definitely buy a hay baler. But as Pritchard explained to me (after preemptively apologizing for a moment of snark), if a farmer actually adopted such a simplistic mind-set, “I’d be counting the days until the ‘For Sale’ sign goes up on the property.” Pritchard, like most practitioners of his trade, instead deploys a more sophisticated thought process when assessing tools. And after applying this process to the hay baler, Pritchard was quick to sell it: Smith Meadows now purchases all the hay it uses. <br><br> Here’s why… <br><br>",
                    "“Let’s start by exploring the costs of making hay,” Pritchard said. “First, there’s the actual cost of fuel, and repairs, and the shed to keep the baler. You also have to pay taxes on it.” These directly measurable costs, however, were the easy part of his decision. It was instead the “opportunity costs” that required more attention. As he elaborated: “If I make hay all summer, I can’t be doing something else. For example, I now use that time instead to raise boilers [chickens meant for eating]. These generate positive cash flow, because I can sell them. But they also produce manure which I can then use to enhance",
                    "my soil.” Then there’s the equally subtle issue of assessing the secondary value of a purchased bale of hay. As Pritchard explained: “When I’m buying in hay, I’m trading cash for animal protein, as well as manure (once it passes through the animals’ system), which means I am also getting more nutrients for my land in exchange for my money. I’m also avoiding compacting soils by driving heavy machinery over my ground all summer long.” <br><br> When making his final decision on the baler, Pritchard moved past the direct monetary costs, which were",

For the reasons described previously, Pritchard concluded that buying in hay results in healthier fields. And as he summarized: “Soil fertility is my baseline.” By this calculation, the baler had to go. <br><br> Notice the complexity of Pritchard’s tool decision. This complexity underscores an important reality: The notion that identifying some benefit is sufficient to invest money, time, and attention in a tool is near laughable to people in his",

He spent an afternoon packing everything he owned into cardboard boxes as if he was about to move. In order to transform what he described as a “difficult undertaking” into something less onerous, he called it a “packing party,” explaining: “Everything’s more exciting when it’s a party, right?”",

As John Freeman warns in his 2009 book, The Tyranny of E-mail, with the rise of this technology “we are slowly eroding our ability to explain—in a careful, complex way—why it is so wrong for us to complain, resist, or redesign our workdays so that they are manageable.” E-mail seems a fait accompli. Resistance is futile.",

Just because you cannot avoid this tool altogether doesn’t mean you have to cede all authority over its role in your mental landscape. In the following sections I describe three tips that will help you regain authority over how this technology accesses your time and attention, and arrest the erosion of autonomy identified by Freeman. Resistance is not futile: You have more control over your electronic communication than you might at first assume. <br><br>",

They include an e-mail address on their author websites along with an open invitation to send them any request or suggestion that comes to mind. Many even encourage this feedback as a necessary commitment to the elusive but much-touted importance of “community building” among their readers. But here’s the thing: I don’t buy it. <br><br> If you visit the contact page on my",
                    "author website, there’s no general-purpose e-mail address. Instead, I list different individuals you can contact for specific purposes: my literary agent for rights requests, for example, or my speaking agent for speaking requests. If you want to reach me, I offer only a special-purpose e-mail address that comes with conditions and a lowered expectation that I’ll respond: <br><br>  <br><br> If you have an offer, opportunity, or introduction that might make my life more interesting, e-mail me at",

For the reasons stated above, I’ll only respond to those proposals that are a good match for my schedule and interests. <br><br>  <br><br> I call this approach a sender filter, as I’m asking my correspondents to filter themselves before attempting to contact me. This filter has significantly reduced the time I spend in my inbox. Before I began using a sender filter, I had a standard general-purpose e-mail address listed on my website. Not surprisingly, I used to receive a",
                    "large volume of long e-mails asking for advice on specific (and often quite complicated) student or career questions. I like to help individuals, but these requests became overwhelming—they didn’t take the senders long to craft but they would require a lot of explanation and writing on my part to respond. My sender filter has eliminated most such communication, and in doing so, has drastically reduced the number of messages I encounter in my writing inbox. As for my own interest in helping my readers, I now redirect this energy toward settings I carefully choose to",

Instead of allowing any student in the world to send me a question, for example, I now work closely with a small number of student groups where I’m quite accessible and can offer more substantial and effective mentoring. <br><br> Another benefit of a sender filter is that it resets expectations. The most crucial line in my description is the following: “I’ll only respond to those proposals that are a good match for my schedule and interests.” This seems minor, but it makes a substantial difference in how my correspondents think",
                    "about their messages to me. The default social convention surrounding e-mail is that unless you’re famous, if someone sends you something, you owe him or her a response. For most, therefore, an inbox full of messages generates a major sense of obligation. <br><br> By instead resetting your correspondents’ expectations to the reality that you’ll probably not respond, the experience is transformed. The inbox is now a collection of opportunities that you can glance at when you have the free time—seeking out those that make sense for you to engage. But",
                    "the pile of unread messages no longer generates a sense of obligation. You could, if you wanted to, ignore them all, and nothing bad would happen. Psychologically, this can be freeing. <br><br> I worried when I first began using a sender filter that it would seem pretentious—as if my time was more valuable than that of my readers—and that it would upset people. But this fear wasn’t realized. Most people easily accept the idea that you have a right to control your own incoming communication, as they would like to enjoy this same right. More",
                    "important, people appreciate clarity. Most are okay to not receive a response if they don’t expect one (in general, those with a minor public presence, such as authors, overestimate how much people really care about their replies to their messages). <br><br> In some cases, this expectation reset might even earn you more credit when you do respond. For example, an editor of an online publication once sent me a guest post opportunity with the assumption, set by my filter, that I would likely not respond. When I did, it proved a happy surprise.",

He didn’t have anything on his [sender filter] about wanting to guest blog, so there wouldn’t have been any hard feelings if I’d never heard a peep. Then, when he did respond, I was thrilled. <br><br>  <br><br> My particular sender filter is just",
                    "one example of this general strategy. Consider consultant Clay Herbert, who is an expert in running crowd-funding campaigns for technology start-ups: a specialty that attracts a lot of correspondents hoping to glean some helpful advice. As a Forbes.com article on sender filters reports, “At some point, the number of people reaching out exceeded [Herbert’s] capacity, so he created filters that put the onus on the person asking for help.” <br><br> Though he started from a similar motivation as me, Herbert’s filters ended up taking a different form.",
                    "To contact him, you must first consult an FAQ to make sure your question has not already been answered (which was the case for a lot of the messages Herbert was processing before his filters were in place). If you make it through this FAQ sieve, he then asks you to fill out a survey that allows him to further screen for connections that seem particularly relevant to his expertise. For those who make it past this step, Herbert enforces a small fee you must pay before communicating with him. This fee is not about making extra money, but is instead about selecting for individuals who are serious about",
                    "receiving and acting on advice. Herbert’s filters still enable him to help people and encounter interesting opportunities. But at the same time, they have reduced his incoming communication to a level he can easily handle. <br><br> To give another example, consider Antonio Centeno, who runs the popular Real Man Style blog. Centeno’s sender filter lays out a two-step process. If you have a question, he diverts you to a public location to post it. Centeno thinks it’s wasteful to answer the same questions again and again in private one-on-one conversations.",

                    "<br><br>  <br><br> The message box in which you can type your message doesn’t appear on the contact page until after you’ve clicked the box by all three promises. <br><br> To summarize, the technologies underlying e-mail are transformative, but the current social conventions guiding how we apply this technology are underdeveloped. The notion that all messages, regardless of purpose or sender, arrive in the same",
                    "undifferentiated inbox, and that there’s an expectation that every message deserves a (timely) response, is absurdly unproductive. The sender filter is a small but useful step toward a better state of affairs, and is an idea whose time has come—at least for the increasing number of entrepreneurs and freelancers who both receive a lot of incoming communication and have the ability to dictate their accessibility.

                    "their inboxes. They’re also potential productivity land mines: How you respond to them will have a significant impact on how much time and attention the resulting conversation ultimately consumes. <br><br> In particular, interrogative e-mails like these generate an initial instinct to dash off the quickest possible response that will clear the message—temporarily—out of your inbox. A quick response will, in the short term, provide you with some minor relief because you’re bouncing the responsibility implied by the message off your court and back onto the sender’s. This relief,",
                    "however, is short-lived, as this responsibility will continue to bounce back again and again, continually sapping your time and attention. I suggest, therefore, that the right strategy when faced with a question of this type is to pause a moment before replying and take the time to answer the following key prompt: <br><br>  <br><br> What is the project represented by this message, and what is the most efficient (in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this project to a successful",
                    "conclusion? <br><br>  <br><br> Once you’ve answered this question for yourself, replace a quick response with one that takes the time to describe the process you identified, points out the current step, and emphasizes the step that comes next.

Let’s meet at the Starbucks on campus. Below I listed two days next week when I’m free. For each day, I listed three times. If any of those day and time combinations work for you, let me know. I’ll consider your reply confirmation for the meeting. If none of those date and time combinations work, give me a call at the number below and we’ll hash out a time that works. Looking forward to it.”",

Once I receive that message, I’ll start a shared directory for the project and add to it a document that summarizes what you sent me, combined with my own memory of our past discussion. In the document, I’ll highlight the two or three most",
                    "promising next steps. <br><br> “We can then take a crack at those next steps for a few weeks and check back in. I suggest we schedule a phone call for a month from now for this purpose. Below I listed some dates and times when I’m available for a call.

In this version I send back, I’ll edit what I can do myself, and add comments to draw your attention to places where I think you’re better suited to make the improvement. At that point, you should have what you need to polish and submit the final draft, so I’ll leave you to do that—no need to reply to this message or to follow up with me after I return the edits—unless, of course, there’s an issue.” <br><br>",
                    "<br><br> In crafting these sample responses, I started by identifying the project implied by the message. Notice, the word “project” is used loosely here. It can cover things that are large and obviously projects, such as making progress on a research problem (Example #2), but it applies just as easily to small logistical challenges like setting up a coffee meeting (Example #1). I then took a minute or two to think through a process that gets us from the current state to a desired outcome with a minimum of messages required. The final step",
                    "was to write a reply that clearly describes this process and where we stand. These examples centered on an e-mail reply, but it should be clear that a similar approach also works when writing an e-mail message from scratch. <br><br> The process-centric approach to e-mail can significantly mitigate the impact of this technology on your time and attention. There are two reasons for this effect. First, it reduces the number of e-mails in your inbox—sometimes significantly (something as simple as scheduling a coffee meeting can easily spiral into half a dozen",
                    "or more messages over a period of many days, if you’re not careful about your replies). This, in turn, reduces the time you spend in your inbox and reduces the brainpower you must expend when you do. <br><br> Second, to steal terminology from David Allen, a good process-centric message immediately “closes the loop” with respect to the project at hand. When a project is initiated by an e-mail that you send or receive, it squats in your mental landscape—becoming something that’s “on your plate” in the sense that it has been brought to your attention and eventually",

By working through the whole process, adding to your task lists and calendar any relevant commitments on your part, and bringing the other party up to speed, your mind can reclaim the mental real estate the project once demanded. Less mental clutter means more mental resources available for deep thinking. <br><br> Process-centric e-mails might not seem natural at first. For one thing, they require that you spend more time thinking about your messages",
                    "before you compose them. In the moment, this might seem like you’re spending more time on e-mail. But the important point to remember is that the extra two to three minutes you spend at this point will save you many more minutes reading and responding to unnecessary extra messages later. <br><br> The other issue is that process-centric messages can seem stilted and overly technical. The current social conventions surrounding e-mail promote a conversational tone that clashes with the more systematic schedules or decision trees commonly used in",
                    "process-centric communication. If this concerns you, I suggest that you add a longer conversational preamble to your messages. You can even separate the process-centric portion of the message from the conversational opening with a divider line, or label it “Proposed Next Steps,” so that its technical tone seems more appropriate in context. <br><br> In the end, these minor hassles are worth it. By putting more thought up front into what’s really being proposed by the e-mail messages that flit in and out of your inbox, you’ll greatly reduce the negative",

There’s also no way to avoid that some bad things will happen if you take this approach. At the minimum, some people might get confused or upset—especially if they’ve never seen",

If you don’t, you’ll never find time for the life-changing big things.” It should comfort you to realize that, as the professors at MIT discovered, people are quick to adjust their expectations to the specifics of your communication habits.

One says that sending e-mails generates more e-mails, while the other says that wrestling with ambiguous or irrelevant e-mails is a major source of inbox-related stress. The approach suggested here responds aggressively to both issues—you send fewer e-mails and ignore those that aren’t easy to process—and by doing so will significantly weaken the grip your inbox maintains over your time and attention."

Be the best, better than the rest. Be smarter, faster, richer, sexier, more popular, more productive, more envied, and more admired <br><br> the problem is that giving too many fucks is bad for your mental health. <br><br> The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important. <br><br> Or you’re so worried about doing the right thing all the time that you become worried about how much you’re worrying. <br> <h3>“I feel like shit, but who gives a fuck?”</h3> <br>  We joke online about “first-world problems,” but we really have become victims of our own success. Stress-related health issues, anxiety disorders, and cases of depression have skyrocketed over the past thirty years, despite the fact that everyone has a flat-screen TV and can have their groceries delivered. Our crisis is no longer material; it’s existential, it’s spiritual. We have so much fucking stuff and so many opportunities that we don’t even know what to give a fuck about anymore. <br><br> The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.  <br><br> The more you desperately want to be rich, the more poor and unworthy you feel, regardless of how much money you actually make. <br><br> The more you desperately want to be happy and loved, the lonelier and more afraid you become, regardless of those who surround you. “You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.” <br> <h3>“Don’t try.”</h3> <br>  The pain you pursue in the gym results in better all-around health and energy. <br><br> The failures in business are what lead to a better understanding of what’s necessary to be successful.  <br><br> Look, this is how it works. You’re going to die one day. I know that’s kind of obvious, but I just wanted to remind you in case you’d forgotten. You and everyone you know are going to be dead soon. And in the short amount of time between here and there, you have a limited amount of fucks to give. Very few, in fact. And if you go around giving a fuck about everything and everyone without conscious thought or choice—well, then you’re going to get fucked.Because when you give too many fucks—when you give a fuck about everyone and everything—you will feel that you’re perpetually entitled to be comfortable and happy at all times, that everything is supposed to be just exactly the fucking way you want it to be. This is a sickness. And it will eat you alive. <br> <h4>Subtlety #1:</h4>  <br>  Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different. <br><br> There’s no such thing as not giving a fuck. You must give a fuck about something. It’s part of our biology to always care about something and therefore to always give a fuck. The question, then, is, What do we give a fuck about? What are we choosing to give a fuck about? And how can we not give a fuck about what ultimately does not matter? <br><br> When we say, “Damn, watch out, Mark Manson just don’t give a fuck,” we don’t mean that Mark Manson doesn’t care about anything; on the contrary, we mean that Mark Manson doesn’t care about adversity in the face of his goals, he doesn’t care about pissing some people off to do what he feels is right or important or noble. <br><br> They say, “Fuck it,” not to everything in life, but rather to everything unimportant in life. <br><br> No matter where you go, there’s a five-hundred-pound load of shit waiting for you. And that’s perfectly fine. The point isn’t to get away from the shit. The point is to find the shit you enjoy dealing with.  <br> <h4>Subtlety #2:</h4> <br>  To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.  <br><br> I once heard an artist say that when a person has no problems, the mind automatically finds a way to invent some. It then follows that finding something important and meaningful in your life is perhaps the most productive use of your time and energy.  <br><h4>Subtlety #3:</h4> <br>  Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about. <br><br> We realize how little attention people pay to the superficial details about us, and we choose not to obsess so much over them. <br><br> Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuck worthy. <br><br> I believe that today we’re facing a psychological epidemic, one in which people no longer realize it’s okay for things to suck sometimes."

People without a family suffer because they have no family. People with a family suffer because of their family. People who pursue worldly pleasures suffer because of their worldly pleasures. People who abstain from worldly pleasures suffer because of their abstention. <br><br> We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful. <br><br> We are wired to become dissatisfied with whatever we have and satisfied by only what we do not have. <br><br> Therefore, it’s not always beneficial to avoid pain and seek pleasure, since pain can, at times, be life-or-death important to our well-being. <br><br> In fact, research has found that our brains don’t register much difference between physical pain and psychological pain. <br><br> Happiness comes from solving problems. The keyword here is “solving.” If you’re avoiding your problems or feel like you don’t have any problems, then you’re going to make yourself miserable. <br><br> To be happy we need something to solve. <br><br> Happiness is a constant work-in-progress, because solving problems is a constant work-in-progress. <br><br> True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving. <br><br> Denial. Some people deny that their problems exist in the first place. And because they deny reality, they must constantly delude or distract themselves from reality. <br><br> Victim Mentality. Some choose to believe that there is nothing they can do to solve their problems, even when they in fact could. Victims seek to blame others for their problems or blame outside circumstances. <br><br> Highs come in many forms. Whether it’s a substance like alcohol, the moral righteousness that comes from blaming others, or the thrill of some new risky adventure, highs are shallow and unproductive ways to go about one’s life. <br><br>  Remember, nobody who is actually happy has to stand in front of a mirror and tell himself that he’s happy.  <br><br> Emotions evolved for one specific purpose: to help us live and reproduce a little bit better. That’s it. They’re feedback mechanisms telling us that something is either likely right or likely wrong for us—nothing more, nothing less.  <br><br> An obsession and over investment in emotion fails us for the simple reason that emotions never last. Whatever makes us happy today will no longer make us happy tomorrow, because our biology always needs something more.  <br><br> The person you marry is the person you fight with. The house you buy is the house you repair. The dream job you take is the job you stress over. <br><br>  Everything comes with an inherent sacrifice—whatever makes us feel good will also inevitably make us feel bad. What we gain is also what we lose.  <br><br> “What pain do you want to sustain?” The path to happiness is a path full of shit heaps and shame.  <br><br> What determines your success isn’t, “What do you want to enjoy?” The relevant question is, “What pain do you want to sustain?” The path to happiness is a path full of shit heaps and shame."

As a rule, people who are terrified of what others think about them are actually terrified of all the shitty things they think about themselves being reflected back at them. Some examples of good, healthy values: honesty, innovation, vulnerability, standing up for oneself, standing up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity. Some examples of bad, unhealthy values: dominance through manipulation or violence, indiscriminate fucking, feeling good all the time, always being the center of attention, not being alone, being liked by everybody, being rich for the sake of being rich, sacrificing small animals to the pagan gods."

Because we are.  Don’t trust your conception of positive/negative experiences. All that we know for certain is what hurts in the moment and what doesn’t. And that’s not worth much. But there are two problems.  First, the brain is imperfect. We mistake things we see and hear. We forget things or misinterpret events quite easily. Second, once we create meaning for ourselves, our brains are designed to hold on to that meaning. We are biased toward the meaning our mind has made, and we don’t want to let go of it. Uncertainty is the root of all progress and all growth.

Rainy days! Stop doing that. Instead of saving for a rainy day, focus on saving for a joyous day or for the day you win your financial freedom. Then, by virtue of the law of intention, that’s exactly what you will get. If your motivation for acquiring money or success comes from a non supportive root such as fear, anger, or the need to “prove” yourself, your money will never bring you happiness.  Because money is not the root of the problem; fear is. What’s even worse is that fear is not just a problem, it’s a habit.  You call yourself a high achiever, a hard driver, determined, and all these traits are fine. The only question is why? What is the root engine that drives all this? The only way to permanently change the temperature in the room is to reset the thermostat. In the same way, the only way to change your level of financial success“permanently” is to reset your financial thermostat.  Consciousness is observing your thoughts and actions so that you can live from true choice in the present moment rather than being run by programming from the past.  Nothing has meaning except for the meaning you give it. Recall how at the beginning of this book I suggested you don’t believe a word I say?

            "text": "Wealth File #1Rich people believe “I create my Life”Poor people believe “Life happens to me.”  When you are complaining, you become a living, breathing “crap magnet.” There is no such thing as a really rich victim!  Believe me, it is virtually impossible to be truly happy and successful when you’re constantly yearning for attention. Wealth File #2Rich people play the money game to win.Poor people play the money game to not lose.  Poor people play the money game on defense rather than offense. The goal of truly rich people is to have massive wealth and abundance.  If your goal is to be comfortable, chances are you’ll never get rich. But if your goal is to be rich, chances are you’ll end up mighty comfortable. Wealth File #3Rich people are committed to being rich.Poor people want to be rich. The number one reason most people don’t get what they want is that they don’t know what they want. The first level is “I want to be rich.” That’s another way of saying, “I’ll take it if it falls in my lap.” Wanting alone is useless.  The second level of wanting is “I choose to be rich.” This entails deciding to become rich. Choosing is a much stronger energy and goes hand in hand with being responsible for creating your reality. The third level of wanting is “I commit to being rich.” The definition of the word commit is “to devote oneself unreservedly.” This means holding absolutely nothing back; giving 100 percent of everything you’ve got to achieving wealth. It means being willing to do whatever it takes for as long as it takes. This is the warrior’s way. No excuses, no ifs, no buts, no maybes—and failure is not an option. The warrior’s way is simple: “I will be rich or I will die trying.” In my experience, getting rich takes focus, courage, knowledge, expertise, 100 percent of your effort, a never-give-up attitude, and of course a rich mind-set.If you are not fully, totally, and truly committed to creating wealth, chances are you won’t. Are you willing to work sixteen hours a day? Rich people are. Are you willing to work seven days a week and give up most of your weekends? Rich people are. Are you willing to sacrifice seeing your family, your friends, and give up your recreations and hobbies? Rich people are. Are you willing to risk all your time, energy, and start-up capital with no guarantee of returns? Rich people are. Wealth File #4Rich people think big.Poor people think small. But hear this: Your life is not just about you. It’s also about contributing to others. It’s about living true to your mission and reason for being here on this earth at this time. It’s about adding your piece of the puzzle to the world. Most people are so stuck in their egos that everything revolves around me, me, and more me. But if you want to be rich in the truest sense of the word, it can’t only be about you. It has to include adding value to other people’s lives. In the end, small thinking and small actions lead to being both broke and unfulfilled. Big thinking and big actions lead to having both money and meaning. The choice is yours!   Wealth File #5Rich people focus on opportunities.Poor people focus on obstacles. Do you want some simple but extremely rare advice? Here it is: If you want to get rich, focus on making, keeping, and investing your money. If you want to be poor, focus on spending your money. Wealth File #6Rich people admire other rich and successful people. Poor people resent rich and successful people. “Bless that which you want.”Wealth File #7Rich people associate with positive, successful people.Poor people associate with negative or unsuccessful people. Also remember that “nothing has meaning expect for the meaning we give it.” I hope you get the point. Instead of mocking rich people, model them. Instead of shying away from rich people, get to know them. Instead of saying, “Wow, they’re so special,” say, “If they can do it, I can do it.” Wealth File #8Rich people are willing to promote themselves and their value. Poor people think negatively about selling and promotion. Rich people are usually leaders, and all great leaders are great promoter. To be a leader, you must inherently have followers and supports, which means that you have to be adept at selling, inspiring, and motivating people to buy into your vision. Leader earn a heck of a lot more money than followers! Wealth File #9Rich people are bigger than their problems.Poor peoples are smaller than their problems. The secret to success is not to try to avoid or get rid of or shrink your problems; the secret is to grow yourself so that you are bigger than any problem. Note that whether you are rich or poor, playing big or playing small, problems do not go away. If you’re breathing, you will always have so-called problems and obstacles in your life. Let me make this short and sweet. The size of the problem is never the issue—what matters is the size of you! If you have a big problem in your life, all that mean is that your being a small person! Don’t be fooled by appearances. Your world is merely a reflection of your inner world. If you want to make a permanent change, stop focusing on the size of your problem and start focusing on the size of you! Think of yourself as your container for wealth. If your container is small and your money is big, what’s going to happen? You will lose it. Your container will overflow and the excess money will spill out all over the place. You simply cannot have more money than the container. Therefore you must grow to be a big container so you cannot only hold more wealth but also attract more wealth.Wealth File #10Rich people are excellent receivers.Poor people are poor receivers. If you say you’re worthy, you are. If you say you’re not worthy, you’re not. Either way you will live into your story. “If a hundred-foot oak tree had the mind of a human, it would only grow to be ten feet tall!” For every giver there must be a receiver, and for every receiver there must be a giver. To make matter worse, when you are not willing to fully receive, you are training the universe not to give to you! It’s simply: if you aren’t willing to receive your share, it will go to someone else who is. That’s one of the reasons the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Not because they’re any more worthy, but because they are willing to receive while most poor people are not. Money will only make you more of what you already are. How you do anything is how you do everything.Wealth File #11Rich people choose to get paid based on results. Poor people choose to get paid based on time. There’s nothing wrong with getting a steady paycheck, unless it interferes with your ability to earn what you’re worth. There’s the rub. Poor people trade their time for money. The problem with this strategy is that your time is limited. Never have a ceiling on your income. “You’ll never get rich working on straight salary for someone else. If you’re going to get a job, make sure you get paid on percentage. Otherwise, go work for yourself!” Wealth File #12Rich people think “both.”Poor people think “either/or.” Do you want a successful career or a close relationship with your family? Both! Do you want to focus on business or have a fun and play? Both! Do you want money or meaning in your life? Both! Do you want to earn a fortune or do the work you love? Both! Poor people always choose one, rich people choose both.  Rich people believe“You can have your cake and eat it too.”Middle-class people believe“Cake is too rich, so I’ll only have a little piece.”Poor people don’t believe they deserve cake, so they order a doughnut, focus on the hole, and wonder why they have “nothing.” Wealth File #13Rich people focus on their net worth. Poor people focus on their working income.  The true measure of wealth is net worth, not working income.  The four net worth factors are: Income Savings Investments Simplification Income comes in two firms: working income and passive income. Saving is also imperative. You can earn wads of money. But if you don’t keep any of it, you will never create wealth. Once you’ve begun saving a decent potion of your income, then you can move to the next stage and make your money grow through Investing. Generally, the better you are at investing, the faster your money will grow and generate a greater net work. Rich people take the time and energy to learn about investing and investments. Simplification. It go hand and hand with saving money, whereby you consciously create a lifestyle in which you need less money to live on. By decreasing your cost of living, you increase your savings and the amount of funds available for investing. In general, as income goes up, expenses almost invariably go up too. That’s why income alone will never create wealth.  “Where attention goes, energy flows and results show.”  Focus on all four net worth factors: Increasing your incomeIncreasing your savingsIncreasing your investment returnsDecreasing your cost of living by simplifying your lifestyle.  Wealth File #14Rich people manage their money well. Poor people mismanage their money well.  “Rich people are good at managing their money.” Rich people manage their money well. Poor people mismanage their money. I don’t know about you, but where I went to school, Money Management 101 wasn’t offered. Instead we learned about the War of 1812, which of course is something I use every single day.  Until you show you can handle what you’ve got, you won’t get any more! Remember, we are creatures of habit, and therefore the habit of managing your money is more important than the amount.  I advise that you create four more accounts. The other accounts include: 10 percent into your Long-Term Savings for Spending Account 10 percent into your Education Account 50 percent into your Necessities Account 10 percent into your Give Account Either you control money, or it will control you.  Open your Financial Freedom bank account. Put 10 percent of all your income (after taxes) into this account. This money is never to be spent, only invested to produce passive income for your retirement.Wealth File #15Rich people have their money work hard for them. Poor people work hard for their money. Yes, in my experience, you do have to work hard for your money. For rich people, however, this is a temporary situation. For poor people, it’s permanent.  I have identified two primary sources of passive income. The first is “money working for you.” This includes investment earnings from financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, T-bills, money markets, mutual funds, as well as owning mortgages or other assets that appreciate in value and can be liquidated for cash. The second major source of passive income is “business working for you.” This entails generating ongoing income from businesses where you do not need to be personally involved for that business to operate and yield an income. Examples include rental real estate; royalties from books, music, or software; licensing your ideas; becoming a franchisor; owning storage units; owning vending or other types of coin-operated machines; and network marketing, to name just a few. Rich people think long-term. They balance their spending on enjoyment today with investing for freedom tomorrow. Poor people think short-term. They run their lives bases on immediate gratification. Poor people choose now, rich people choose balance. Rich people buy assets, things that will likely go up in value. Poor people buy expenses, things that will definitely go down in value. Rich people collect land. Poor people collect bills. Rich people see every dollar as a “seed” that can be planted to earn a hundred more dollars, which can then be replanted to earn a thousand more dollars.  Change your focus from “active” income to “passive” income. List at least three specific strategies with which you could create income without working, in either the investment or the business field. Begin researching and then take action on these strategies. Don’t wait to buy real estate. Buy real estate and wait.  Wealth File #16Rich people act in spite of fear. Poor people let fear stop them. Action is the “bridge” between the inner world and the outer world.  Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway. — Book to read It is not necessary to try to get rid of fear in order to succeed. If you are willing to do only what’s easy, life will be hard. But if you are willing to do what’s hard, life will be easy.  But let me tell you a secret that only rich and highly successful people know: being comfortable is highly overrated. Being comfortable may make you feel warm, fuzzy, and secure, but it doesn’t allow you to grow. To grow as a person you have to expand your comfort zone. The only time you can actually grow is when you are outside your comfort zone.  The only time you are actually growing is when you are uncomfortable. CZ = WZ It mean your “comfort zone” equals your “wealth zone.” By expanding your comfort zone, you will expand the size of your income and wealth zone. The more comfortable you have to be, the fewer risky you will be willing to take, the fewer opportunities you will take advantage of, the fewer people you will meet, and the fewer new strategies you will try. On the contrary, when you are willing to s-t-r-e-t-c-h yourself, you expand your opportunity zone, and this allows you to attract and hold more income and wealth. Again, when you have a larger “container” (comfort zone), the universe will rush to fill the space. Rich and successful people have a big comfort zone, and they are constantly expanding it to be able to attain and hole more wealth. Comfort kills! If your goal in life is to be comfortable, I guarantee two thing. First, you will never be rich. Second, you will never be happy. Try this. The next time you are felling uncomfortable, uncertain, or afraid, instead of thinking and retreating back to safety, press forward. Training and managing your own mind is the most important skill you could ever own, in term of both happiness and success. Wealth File #17Rich people constantly learn and grow.Poor people think they already know. You can be right or you can be rich, but you can’t be both. Take any plant. If isn’t growing, it is dying. It’s the same with people as well as all other living organisms: if you are not growing, you are dying. By the way, if you don’t have the time to do the things you want to do or need to do, you’re most probably a modern slave. “Every master was once a disaster.” No one comes out of the womb a financial genius. Every rich person learned how to succeed at the money game, and so can you. Remember, your motto is, if they can do it, I can do it!  I want to share a secret with you that few people know: the fastest way to get rich and stay rich is to work on developing you! Rich people understand the order to success is BE, DO, HAVE. Poor and middle-class people believe the order to success is HAVE, DO, BE. Here’s something else only rich people know: the goal of creating wealth is not primarily to have a lot of money, the goal of creating wealth is to help you grow yourself into the best person you can possibly be.  To get paid the best, you must be the best. Rich people take advice from people who are richer than they are. Poor people take advice from their friends, who are just as broke as they are."
