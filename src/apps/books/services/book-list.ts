A few more bars and it became vividly clear. I knew exactly what was happening. Jackie, as always, was speaking through her cello. I could hear what she was saying. . . .

Behind the popular facade of a confident and determined fighter, Ms. Rodriguez was a frightened and lonely person with a very fragile support system, alienated from her estranged husband and from her family. It was a multi-layered scenario.

She had control over her life and preferred to have control over her death.” As with all ALS patients, the reality was rather more contradictory. Strong convictions do not necessarily signal a powerful sense of self: very often quite the opposite.

As a young adult, Barbara became addicted to narcotic painkillers and tranquilizers that she would inject into her body. Right up to the time of her diagnosis with breast cancer, she was fighting her addiction to drugs.

His nipples felt sore, and he had to drop out of the 1997 Tour de France owing to a cough and low-back pain. “Athletes, especially cyclists, are in the business of denial,” Lance Armstrong writes. <span class=\"Endnote-reference _idGenCharOverride-2\">19 </span>It wasn’t until September, when he coughed blood and his testicle became </span></p>",

Thirty-year-old Roy first felt the swelling in his left testicle in mid-2000 but put off going to his family doctor for another eight months. In the meantime, he told no one. “I was a little embarrassed and secondly I was afraid of getting bad news,” he says. According to a British study, such reluctance to get help is not untypical with this disease: “Delayed diagnosis is </span></p>",

He tied my wrists and tied my ankles and put me out in the backyard.

It is inevitable that a child in that situation would have deep hurt around that failure—and anger not only at the abusive stepfather but also at the mother who could not keep him safe.

Jerry, my husband, was in his last year of dental school in Montana. I was twenty-three with three kids.” The children were four, two and the baby was only five months old. The family had no income yet, so Martha was doing babysitting and whatever other work she could get.

According to Randy, Caitlin “bottled up a lot of emotion,” particularly when she was upset. There were two items she would rarely talk about: her terminal illness and her childhood. “If she mentioned her childhood at all, it would be about the few good times that she had.” </span></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"Text\"><span class=\"dg-dgen\">From Randy’s perspective, there was every indication that the good times in his wife’s childhood had </span></p>",

When I am in a rage, my face is tight, my muscles are tense and I am sure I look anything but relaxed. Here Dr. Kalpin makes a crucial distinction. “The question is, What do people really experience when they experience rage? It’s fascinating to ask people. If you really ask, the majority of people will describe anxiety. If you ask in physical, physiologic terms what they are experiencing in their body when they feel rage, for the most part, people will describe anxiety in one form or another.” </span></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"Text\"><span class=\"dg-dgen\">“It’s true,” I said, “tightening of the </span></p>",
                    "voice, shallow breathing, muscle tension are signs of anxiety, not of anger.” </span></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"Text\"><span class=\"dg-dgen\">“Exactly. Their anger is not physiologically experienced, it is only being acted out.” </span></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"Text\"><span class=\"dg-dgen\">Acting out through bursts of rage is a defence against the anxiety that invariably accompanies anger in a child. Anger triggers anxiety because it coexists with positive feelings, with love and the desire for contact. But since anger leads to an attacking energy, it threatens attachment. Thus there is something basically anxiety-provoking about the <span class=\"Italic\">anger experience </span>, even without external, </span></p>",
                    "parental injunctions against <span class=\"Italic\">anger expression. </span>“Aggressive impulses are suppressed because of guilt, and the guilt exists only because of the simultaneous existence of love, of positive feelings,” says Allen Kalpin. “So, the anger doesn’t exist in a vacuum by itself. It is incredibly anxiety-provoking and guilt-producing for a person to experience aggressive feelings toward a loved one.” </span></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"Text\"><span class=\"dg-dgen\">Naturally, the more parents discourage or forbid the experience of anger, the more anxiety-producing that experience will be for the child. In all cases where anger is completely repressed or </span></p>",
                    "where chronic repression alternates with explosive eruptions of rage, the early childhood history was one in which the parents were unable to accept the child’s natural anger. </span></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"Text\"><span class=\"dg-dgen\">If a person unconsciously fears the power of his aggressive impulses, there are various forms of defence available to him. One category of defence is discharge, by which we regress to an early childhood state when we dealt with the intolerable buildup of anger by acting it out. “You see, the acting-out, the yelling, the screaming and even the hitting, all that a person does, serves as a defence against the </span></p>",
                    "experience of the anger. It’s a defence against keeping the anger inside where it can be deeply felt. Discharge defends against anger being actually experienced.” </span></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"Text\"><span class=\"dg-dgen\">The other way we can avoid the experience of anger is through repression. So repression and discharge are two sides of the same coin. Both represent fear and anxiety, and for that reason, both trigger physiological stress responses regardless of what we consciously feel or do not feel. </span></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"Text\"><span class=\"dg-dgen\">The paralyzing difficulty many people have with anger toward loved ones is illustrated repeatedly in the interviews we have seen. </span></p>",

Childhood stressors such as emotional or sexual abuse, violence, drug use or mental illness in the family were correlated with adult risk behaviours, health outcomes and death. There was a “strong graded relationship” between dysfunction in the family of origin and adult health status—that is, the greater the exposure to dysfunction had been in childhood, the worse the health status was in the adult and the greater were the chances of untimely death from cancer, heart disease, injury or other causes. <span class=\"Endnote-reference _idGenCharOverride-2\">9 </span></span></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"Text\"><span class=\"dg-dgen\"></span></p>",

Anna, with breast cancer, was born Jewish and was brought up in her ancestral religion. She now goes to a Catholic cathedral for spiritual sustenance. “My beloved is God, and that’s why I stay strong. I go to church, and I take Communion; I know that I am beloved of God. I serve at the altar. The first time I did it, I held the </span></p>",
                    "crucifix and two candles, and the priest said to me, ‘You are the altar <span class=\"Italic\">. </span>’ I’ve been saying that to myself, especially when I feel really awful: <span class=\"Italic\">I’m the altar. </span>And the priest said to me, ‘If you’re the altar of God there in the cathedral, you are the altar of God all the time. You are . . . beloved.’” </span></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"Text\"><span class=\"dg-dgen\">On the other hand, Lillian, a woman with arthritis I interviewed, has turned from Presbyterianism to Judaism.

She is still </span></p>",

Each seeks his or her own way to the light within and without. For many it is not an easy search.

As my classmate took a full swing, the bat slipped out of his hands and came flying toward me before striking me directly between the eyes. I have no memory of the moment of impact. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The bat smashed into my face with such force that it crushed my nose into a distorted U-shape. The collision sent the soft tissue of my brain slamming into the inside of my skull. Immediately, a wave of </p></div>",
                    "swelling surged throughout my head. In a fraction of a second, I had a broken nose, multiple skull fractures, and two shattered eye sockets. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">When I opened my eyes, I saw people staring at me and running over to help. I looked down and noticed spots of red on my clothes. One of my classmates took the shirt off his back and handed it to me. I used it to plug the stream of blood rushing from my broken nose. Shocked and confused, I was unaware of how seriously I had been injured. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">My teacher looped his arm around my shoulder and we began the </p></div>",
                    "long walk to the nurse’s office: across the field, down the hill, and back <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_2\" title=\"2\">&nbsp;</span>into school. Random hands touched my sides, holding me upright. We took our time and walked slowly. Nobody realized that every minute mattered. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">When we arrived at the nurse’s office, she asked me a series of questions. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">“What year is it?” </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">“1998,” I answered. It was actually 2002. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">“Who is the president of the United States?” </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">“Bill Clinton,” I said. The correct answer was George W. Bush. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">“What is your mom’s name?” </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"></p></div>",
                    "“Uh. Um.” I stalled. Ten seconds passed. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">“Patti,” I said casually, ignoring the fact that it had taken me ten seconds to remember my own mother’s name. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">That is the last question I remember. My body was unable to handle the rapid swelling in my brain and I lost consciousness before the ambulance arrived. Minutes later, I was carried out of school and taken to the local hospital. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Shortly after arriving, my body began shutting down. I struggled with basic functions like swallowing and breathing. I had my first </p></div>",
                    "seizure of the day. Then I stopped breathing entirely. As the doctors hurried to supply me with oxygen, they also decided the local hospital was unequipped to handle the situation and ordered a helicopter to fly me to a larger hospital in Cincinnati. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">I was rolled out of the emergency room doors and toward the helipad across the street. The stretcher rattled on a bumpy sidewalk as one nurse pushed me along while another pumped each breath into me by hand. My mother, who had arrived at the hospital a few moments before, climbed into the helicopter beside me. I remained </p></div>",

He choked back tears as he explained to my sister that he would miss her eighth-grade graduation ceremony that night. After passing my siblings off to family and friends, he drove to Cincinnati to meet my mother. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">When my mom and I landed on the roof of the hospital, a team of nearly twenty doctors and nurses sprinted onto the helipad and </p></div>",
                    "wheeled me into the trauma unit. By this time, the swelling in my brain had become so severe that I was having repeated post-traumatic seizures. My broken bones needed to be fixed, but I was in no condition to undergo surgery. After yet another seizure—my third of the day—I was put into a medically induced coma and placed on a ventilator. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">My parents were no strangers to this hospital. Ten years earlier, they had entered the same building on the ground floor after my sister was diagnosed with leukemia at age three. I was five at the time. My brother was just six months old. </p></div>",
                    "After two and a half years of chemotherapy treatments, spinal taps, and bone marrow biopsies, my little sister finally walked out of the hospital happy, healthy, and cancer free. And now, after ten years of normal life, my parents found themselves back in the same place with a different child. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">While I slipped into a coma, the hospital sent a priest and a social worker to comfort my parents. It was the same priest who had met with them a decade earlier on the evening they found out my sister had cancer. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">As day faded into night, a series of machines kept me alive. My </p></div>",
                    "parents slept restlessly on a hospital mattress—one moment they would collapse from fatigue, the next they would be wide awake with worry. My mother would tell me later, “It was one of the worst nights I’ve ever had.” </p><h3 class=\"x05-Head-A\"><span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_4\" title=\"4\">&nbsp;</span>MY RECOVERY </h3><p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Mercifully, by the next morning my breathing had rebounded to the point where the doctors felt comfortable releasing me from the coma. When I finally regained consciousness, I discovered that I had lost my ability to smell. As a test, a nurse asked me to blow my nose and sniff an apple juice box. </p></div>",
                    "My sense of smell returned, but—to everyone’s surprise—the act of blowing my nose forced air through the fractures in my eye socket and pushed my left eye outward. My eyeball bulged out of the socket, held precariously in place by my eyelid and the optic nerve attaching my eye to my brain. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The ophthalmologist said my eye would gradually slide back into place as the air seeped out, but it was hard to tell how long this would take. I was scheduled for surgery one week later, which would allow me some additional time to heal. I looked like I had been on the wrong end of a boxing match, but I was </p></div>",
                    "cleared to leave the hospital. I returned home with a broken nose, half a dozen facial fractures, and a bulging left eye. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The following months were hard. It felt like everything in my life was on pause. I had double vision for weeks; I literally couldn’t see straight. It took more than a month, but my eyeball did eventually return to its normal location. Between the seizures and my vision problems, it was eight months before I could drive a car again. At physical therapy, I practiced basic motor patterns like walking in a straight line. I was determined not to let my injury get me down, but </p></div>",
                    "there were more than a few moments when I felt depressed and overwhelmed. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">I became painfully aware of how far I had to go when I returned to the baseball field one year later. Baseball had always been a major part of my life. My dad had played minor league baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals, and I had a dream of playing professionally, too. After <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_5\" title=\"5\">&nbsp;</span>months of rehabilitation, what I wanted more than anything was to get back on the field. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">But my return to baseball was not smooth. When the season rolled around, I was the only junior to be cut from the varsity baseball team. </p></div>",
                    "I was sent down to play with the sophomores on junior varsity. I had been playing since age four, and for someone who had spent so much time and effort on the sport, getting cut was humiliating. I vividly remember the day it happened. I sat in my car and cried as I flipped through the radio, desperately searching for a song that would make me feel better. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">After a year of self-doubt, I managed to make the varsity team as a senior, but I rarely made it on the field. In total, I played eleven innings of high school varsity baseball, barely more than a single game. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"></p></div>",
                    "Despite my lackluster high school career, I still believed I could become a great player. And I knew that if things were going to improve, I was the one responsible for making it happen. The turning point came two years after my injury, when I began college at Denison University. It was a new beginning, and it was the place where I would discover the surprising power of small habits for the first time. </p><h3 class=\"x05-Head-A\">HOW I LEARNED ABOUT HABITS </h3><p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Attending Denison was one of the best decisions of my life. I earned a spot on the baseball team and, </p></div>",
                    "although I was at the bottom of the roster as a freshman, I was thrilled. Despite the chaos of my high school years, I had managed to become a college athlete. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">I wasn’t going to be starting on the baseball team anytime soon, so I focused on getting my life in order. While my peers stayed up late and played video games, I built good sleep habits and went to bed early each night. In the messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_6\" title=\"6\">&nbsp;</span>keep my room neat and tidy. These improvements were minor, but they gave me a sense of control over my life. I started to feel confident again. And this growing </p></div>",
                    "belief in myself rippled into the classroom as I improved my study habits and managed to earn straight A’s during my first year. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in many cases, automatically. As each semester passed, I accumulated small but consistent habits that ultimately led to results that were unimaginable to me when I started. For example, for the first time in my life, I made it a habit to lift weights multiple times per week, and in the years that followed, my six-foot-four-inch frame bulked up from a featherweight 170 to a lean 200 </p></div>",
                    "pounds. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">When my sophomore season arrived, I earned a starting role on the pitching staff. By my junior year, I was voted team captain and at the end of the season, I was selected for the all-conference team. But it was not until my senior season that my sleep habits, study habits, and strength-training habits really began to pay off. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Six years after I had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, flown to the hospital, and placed into a coma, I was selected as the top male athlete at Denison University and named to the ESPN Academic All-America Team—an honor given </p></div>",
                    "to just thirty-three players across the country. By the time I graduated, I was listed in the school record books in eight different categories. That same year, I was awarded the university’s highest academic honor, the President’s Medal. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">I hope you’ll forgive me if this sounds boastful. To be honest, there was nothing legendary or historic about my athletic career. I never ended up playing professionally. However, looking back on those years, I believe I accomplished something just as rare: I fulfilled my potential. And I believe the concepts in this book </p></div>",
                    "can help you fulfill your potential as well. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We all face challenges in life. This injury was one of mine, and the <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_7\" title=\"7\">&nbsp;</span>experience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText0\">&nbsp;</span>We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Maybe there are people who can achieve incredible success </p></div>",
                    "overnight. I don’t know any of them, and I’m certainly not one of them. There wasn’t one defining moment on my journey from medically induced coma to Academic All-American; there were many. It was a gradual evolution, a long series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs. The only way I made progress—the only choice I had—was to start small. And I employed this same strategy a few years later when I started my own business and began working on this book. </p><h3 class=\"x05-Head-A\">HOW AND WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK </h3><p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">In November 2012, I began </p></div>",

Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText15\">&nbsp;</span>you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done.

It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">This can be a difficult concept to appreciate in daily life. We often <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_17\" title=\"17\">&nbsp;</span>dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in the moment.

Gradually, each cat learned to associate the action of pressing the lever with the reward of escaping the box and getting to the food. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">After twenty to thirty trials, this behavior became so automatic and habitual that the cat could escape within a few seconds.

                    "backbone of every habit, and your brain runs through these steps in the same order each time. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_48\" title=\"48\">&nbsp;</span>behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards like food, water, and sex. Today, we spend most of our time learning cues that predict secondary rewards like money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and friendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction.

Because the cue is the first indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a craving. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act. What you </p></div>",

Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. This is an important point that we will discuss in detail later. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Cravings differ from person to person. In theory, any piece of information could trigger a craving, but in practice, people are not motivated by the same cues. For a </p></div>",

The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_49\" title=\"49\">&nbsp;</span>a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the </p></div>",

If you want to dunk a basketball but can’t jump high enough to reach the hoop, well, you’re out of luck. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Finally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards </p></div>",

Generally speaking, good habits will have net positive outcomes. Bad habits have net negative outcomes. Smoking a cigarette may reduce stress right now (that’s how it’s serving you), but it’s not a healthy long-term behavior. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">If you’re still having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, here is a question I like to use: “Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be?

Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">As you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to change anything at first. The goal is to simply notice what is actually going on. Observe your thoughts and actions without judgment or internal <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_66\" title=\"66\">&nbsp;</span>criticism.

If you feel like you need extra help, then you can try Pointing-and-Calling in your own life. Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and what the outcome will be.

It adds weight to the action rather than letting yourself mindlessly slip into an old routine. This approach is useful even if you’re simply trying to remember a task on your to-do list. Just saying out loud, “Tomorrow, I need to go to the post office after lunch,” increases the odds that you’ll actually do it. You’re getting yourself to acknowledge the need for action—and that can make all the difference. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. </p></div>",

The researchers also explained to the group how exercise could reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and improve heart health. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Finally, there was the third group. These subjects received the same presentation as the second group, which ensured that they had equal levels of motivation. However, they were also asked to formulate a plan for when and where they would exercise over the following week. Specifically, each member of the third group completed the following sentence: “During the next week, I will partake in at least </p></div>",
                    "20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].” </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In the first and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of people exercised <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_70\" title=\"70\">&nbsp;</span>at least once per week. (Interestingly, the motivational presentation given to the second group seemed to have no meaningful impact on behavior.) But 91 percent of the third group exercised at least once per week—more than double the normal rate. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an <i>implementation intention </i>, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act.

Implementation intentions leverage both of these cues. </p><p class=\"x06-Extract-First\">Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is: </p><p class=\"x06-Extract-Last\">“When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.” </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Hundreds of studies have shown that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText55\">&nbsp;</span>implementation intentions are effective for sticking to our goals, </p></div>",

Too many people try to change their habits without these basic details figured out.

It is not always obvious when and where to take action. Some people spend their entire lives waiting for the time to be right to make an improvement. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Once an implementation intention has been set, you don’t have to wait for inspiration to strike. <i>Do I write a chapter today or not?

                    "and pull you off course. We often say yes to little requests because we are not clear enough about what we need to be doing instead.

When Catherine the Great, the Empress of Russia, heard of Diderot’s financial troubles, her heart went out to him. She was a book lover and greatly enjoyed his encyclopedia.

In fact, the tendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText67\">&nbsp;</span>The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">You can spot this pattern everywhere.

To begin one experiment, he created a collection of fake cardboard beaks, just a head without a body. When the parents had flown away, he went over to the nest and offered these dummy beaks to the chicks. The beaks were obvious fakes, and he assumed the baby birds would reject them altogether. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">However, when the tiny gulls saw the red spot on the cardboard beak, they pecked away just as if it were attached to their own mother. They had a clear preference for those red spots—as if they had </p></div>",

By implanting electrodes in the brains of rats, the researchers blocked the release of dopamine. To the surprise of the scientists, the <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText104\"></span></p></div>",
                    "&nbsp;</span>rats lost all will to live. They wouldn’t eat. They wouldn’t have sex. They didn’t crave anything. Within a few days, the animals died of thirst. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the dopamine-releasing parts of the brain, but this time, they squirted little droplets of sugar into the mouths of the dopamine-depleted rats. Their little rat faces lit up with pleasurable grins from the tasty substance. Even though dopamine was blocked, they <i>liked </i>the sugar just as much as before; they just didn’t <i>want </i>it anymore. The ability to experience pleasure remained, </p></div>",

And <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText105\">&nbsp;</span>without desire, action stopped. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">When other researchers reversed this process and flooded the reward system of the brain with dopamine, animals performed habits at breakneck speed. In one study, mice received a powerful hit of dopamine each time they poked their nose in a box.

The same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food, drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">For years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion, and voluntary </p></div>",

Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right <i>before </i>they place a bet, not after they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine when they <i>see </i>the powder, not after they take it. Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation.

This is one reason the anticipation of an experience can often feel better than the attainment of it. As a child, thinking about Christmas morning can be better than opening the gifts.

Putting his engineering skills to use, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText114\">&nbsp;</span>Byrne hacked his stationary bike and connected it to his laptop and television. Then he wrote a computer program that would allow Netflix to run <i>only </i>if he was cycling at a certain speed. If he slowed down for too long, whatever show he was watching would pause until he started pedaling </p></div>",

Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do. In Byrne’s case, he bundled watching Netflix (the thing he wanted to do) with riding his stationary bike (the thing he needed to do). </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Businesses are masters at temptation bundling. For instance, when the American Broadcasting Company, more commonly known as ABC, launched its </p></div>",
                    "Thursday-night television lineup for the 2014–2015 season, they promoted temptation bundling on a massive scale. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Every Thursday, the company would air three shows created by screenwriter Shonda Rhimes— <i>Grey’s Anatomy </i>, <i>Scandal </i>, and <i>How to Get Away with Murder </i>. They branded it as “TGIT on ABC” (TGIT stands for Thank God It’s Thursday). In addition to promoting the shows, ABC encouraged viewers to make popcorn, drink red wine, and enjoy the evening. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Andrew Kubitz, head of scheduling for ABC, described the idea behind the campaign: “ <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText116\">&nbsp;</span>We see Thursday </p></div>",
                    "night as a viewership opportunity, with either couples or women by themselves who want to sit down and escape and have fun and drink their red wine and have some popcorn.” The brilliance of this strategy is that ABC was associating the thing they <i>needed </i>viewers to do (watch their shows) with activities their viewers already <i>wanted </i>to do (relax, drink wine, and eat popcorn). </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Over time, people began to connect watching ABC with feeling relaxed and entertained. If you drink red wine and eat popcorn at 8 p.m. every Thursday, then eventually “8 p.m. on Thursday” <i></i></p></div>",
                    "means </i>relaxation and entertainment. The reward gets associated with the cue, and the habit of turning on the television becomes more attractive. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">You’re more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do one of your favorite things at the same time. Perhaps you want to hear about the latest celebrity gossip, but you need to get in shape.

With each repetition, cell-to-cell signaling improves and the neural connections tighten. First described by neuropsychologist Donald Hebb in 1949, this phenomenon is commonly known </p></div>",

                    "One of the most effective ways to reduce the friction associated with your habits is to practice environment design. In Chapter 6, we discussed environment design as a method for making cues more obvious, but you can also optimize your environment to make actions easier. For example, when deciding where to practice a new habit, it is best to choose a place that is already along the path of your daily routine. Habits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of your life. You are more likely to go to the gym if it is on your way to work because stopping doesn’t add much friction to your lifestyle. </p></div>",

He is also someone who understands the power of priming his environment. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText152\">&nbsp;</span>Nuckols dialed in his cleaning habits by following a strategy he refers to as “resetting the room.” For instance, when he finishes watching television, he places the remote back on the TV stand, arranges the pillows on the couch, and folds the blanket. When he leaves his car, he throws any trash away. Whenever he takes a shower, he wipes down the toilet while the shower is warming up. (As he notes, the “ <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText153\">&nbsp;</span>perfect time to clean </p></div>",
                    "the toilet is right before you wash yourself in the shower anyway.”) The purpose of resetting each room is not simply to clean up after the last action, but to prepare for the next action. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">“When I walk into a room everything is in its right place,” Nuckols wrote. “Because I do this every day in every room, stuff always stays in good shape. . . . People think I work hard but I’m actually really lazy. I’m just proactively lazy. It gives you so much time back.” </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Whenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are priming it to make the next action </p></div>",

The greater the friction, the less likely the habit. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Whenever possible, I leave my phone in a different room until lunch.

He spent his childhood doing chores on the family farm and working shifts at his father’s sawmill. After attending college at Dartmouth, Patterson returned to Ohio and opened a small supply store for coal miners. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">It seemed like a good opportunity. </p></div>",
                    "The store faced little competition and enjoyed a steady stream of customers, but still struggled to make money. That was when Patterson discovered his employees were stealing from him. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In the mid-1800s, employee theft was a common problem. Receipts were kept in an open drawer and could easily be altered or discarded. There were no video cameras to review behavior and no software to track transactions. Unless you were willing to hover over your employees every minute of the day, or to manage all transactions yourself, it was difficult to prevent theft. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"></p></div>",
                    "As Patterson mulled over his predicament, he came across an advertisement for a new invention called Ritty’s Incorruptible Cashier. <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_172\" title=\"172\">&nbsp;</span>Designed by fellow Dayton resident James Ritty, it was the first cash register. The machine automatically locked the cash and receipts inside after each transaction. Patterson bought two for fifty dollars each. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Employee theft at his store vanished overnight. In the next six months, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText166\">&nbsp;</span>Patterson’s business went from losing money to making $5,000 in profit—the equivalent of more than $100,000 today. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Patterson was so impressed with </p></div>",

Ten years later, National Cash Register had over one thousand employees and was on its way to becoming one of the most successful businesses of its time. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do.

In my research, I came across the story of a woman who had a narcissistic relative who drove her nuts.

It can be hard to feel satisfied when there is no action in the first place.

Habit tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues like the streak of <i>X </i>’s on your calendar or the list of meals in your food log. </p></div>",

Each small win feeds your desire. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">This can be particularly powerful on a bad day. When you’re feeling down, it’s easy to forget about all the progress you have already made. Habit tracking provides visual proof of your hard work—a subtle reminder of how far you’ve come. Plus, the empty square you see each morning can motivate you to get started because you don’t want to lose your progress by breaking the streak. </p><h4 class=\"x05-Head-B\">Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying. </h4><p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\"></p></div>",

It feels good to watch your results grow—the size of your investment portfolio, the length of your book manuscript—and if it feels good, then you’re more likely to endure. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused on the process rather than the result.

It can feel like a burden because it forces you into <i>two </i>habits: the habit you’re trying to build and the habit of tracking it. Counting calories sounds like a hassle when you’re already struggling to follow a diet. Writing down every sales call seems tedious when you’ve got work to do. It feels easier to say, “I’ll just eat less.” Or, “I’ll try harder.” Or, “I’ll remember to do it.” People inevitably tell me things like, “I have a decision journal, but I wish I used </p></div>",
                    "it more.” Or, “I recorded my workouts for a week, but then quit.” I’ve been there myself. I once made a food log to track my calories. I managed to do it for <i>one meal </i>and then gave up. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Tracking isn’t for everyone, and there is no need to measure your entire life. But nearly anyone can benefit from it in some form—even if it’s only temporary. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">What can we do to make tracking easier? </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">First, whenever possible, measurement should be automated.

Any sitting president would have access to launch codes that could kill millions of people but would never actually see anyone die because he would always be thousands of miles away. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">“My suggestion was quite simple,” he wrote in 1981. “Put that [nuclear] code number in a little capsule, and then implant that capsule right </p></div>",

When the consequences are severe, people learn quickly. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior.

To be productive, the cost of procrastination must be greater than the cost of action. To be healthy, the cost of laziness must be greater than the cost of exercise. Getting fined for smoking in a restaurant or failing to recycle adds consequence to an action.

Shortly after the birth of his son, Harris realized he wanted to shed a few pounds. He wrote up a habit contract between himself, his wife, and his personal trainer.

For example, “Write down all food that he consumes each </p></div>",
                    "day and weigh himself each day.” </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">And then he listed the punishment if he failed: “If Bryan doesn’t do these two items then the following consequence will be enforced: He will have to dress up each workday and each Sunday morning for the rest of the quarter. Dress up is defined as not wearing jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, or shorts. He will also give Joey (his trainer) $200 to use as he sees fit if he misses one day of logging food.” </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">At the bottom of the page, Harris, his wife, and his trainer all signed the contract. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">My initial reaction was that a contract like this seemed overly </p></div>",
                    "formal and unnecessary, especially the signatures. But Harris convinced me that signing the contract was an indication of seriousness. “Anytime I skip this part,” he said, “I start slacking almost immediately.” </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Three months later, after hitting his targets for Q1, Harris upgraded his goals. The consequences escalated, too. If he missed his carbohydrate and protein targets, he had to pay his trainer $100. And if he failed to weigh himself, he had to give his wife $500 to use as she saw fit. Perhaps most painfully, if he forgot to run sprints, he had to dress up for work every day and </p></div>",

                    "Guerrouj is a Moroccan runner who holds two Olympic gold medals and is one of the greatest middle-distance runners of all time. For many years, he held the world record in the mile, 1,500-meter, and 2,000-meter races. At the Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, in 2004, he won gold in the 1,500-meter and 5,000-meter races. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">These two athletes are wildly different in many ways.

The team started the 1985–1986 NBA season with an astounding 29–5 record. “ <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText235\">&nbsp;</span>The pundits were saying that we might be the best team in the history of basketball,” head coach Pat Riley said after the season.

The “best team in the history of basketball” didn’t even play for the NBA championship. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">After that blow, Riley was tired of hearing about how much talent his players had and about how much promise his team held. He didn’t want to see flashes of brilliance followed by a gradual fade in performance. He wanted the Lakers to play up to their potential, night after night. In the summer of 1986, he created a plan to do exactly that, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText236\">&nbsp;</span>a system that he called the Career Best Effort program or CBE. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">“When players first join the Lakers,” </p></div>",

He asked each player to “improve their output by at <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_243\" title=\"243\">&nbsp;</span>least 1 percent over the course of the season. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText237\">&nbsp;</span>If they succeeded, it would be a CBE, or Career Best Effort.” Similar to the British Cycling team that we discussed in Chapter </p></div>",
                    "1, the Lakers sought peak performance by getting slightly better each day. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Riley was careful to point out that CBE was not merely about points or statistics but about giving your “best effort spiritually and mentally and physically.” Players got credit for “allowing an opponent to run into you when you know that a foul will be called against him, diving for loose balls, going after rebounds whether you are likely to get them or not, helping a teammate when the player he’s guarding has surged past him, and other ‘unsung hero’ deeds.” </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">As an example, let’s say that Magic </p></div>",

Magic also got credit for an “unsung hero” deed by diving after a loose ball (+1). Finally, he played a total of 33 minutes in this imaginary game. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The positive numbers (11 + 8 + 12 + 2 + 1) add up to 34. Then, we subtract the 5 turnovers (34–5) to get 29.

As Riley put it, “We rank team members alongside league opponents who play the same position and have similar role definitions.” </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Sportswriter Jackie MacMullan noted, “Riley trumpeted the top performers in the league in bold lettering on the blackboard each week <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_244\" title=\"244\">&nbsp;</span>and measured them against the corresponding players on his own roster.

                    "while elite players scored at least 800. Magic Johnson, who submitted 138 triple-doubles in his career, often scored over 1,000.” </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The Lakers also emphasized year-over-year progress by making historical comparisons of CBE data. Riley said, “We stacked the month of November 1986, next to November 1985, and showed the players whether they were doing better or worse than at the same point last season. Then we showed them how their performance figures for December 1986, stacked up against November’s.” </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The Lakers rolled out CBE in October 1986. Eight months later, </p></div>",
                    "they were NBA champions. The following year, Pat Riley led his team to another title as the Lakers became the first team in twenty years to win back-to-back NBA championships. Afterward, he said, “ <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText238\">&nbsp;</span>Sustaining an effort is the most important thing for any enterprise. The way to be successful is to learn how to do things right, then do them the same way every time.” </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The CBE program is a prime example of the power of reflection and review. The Lakers were already talented. CBE helped them get the most out of what they had, and made sure their habits improved rather than declined. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"></p></div>",
                    "Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for improvement. Without reflection, we can make excuses, create rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. We have no process for determining whether we are performing better or worse compared to yesterday. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Top performers in all fields engage in various types of reflection and review, and the process doesn’t have to be complex.

                    "HOW TO BREAK THE BELIEFS THAT HOLD YOU BACK </h3><p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">In the beginning, repeating a habit is essential to build up evidence of your desired identity. As you latch on to that new identity, however, those same beliefs can hold you back from the next level of growth. When working against you, your identity creates a kind of “pride” that encourages you to deny your weak spots and prevents you from truly growing. This is one of the greatest downsides of building habits. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The more sacred an idea is to us—that is, the more deeply it is tied to our identity—the more strongly we </p></div>",
                    "will defend it against criticism. You see this in every industry. The schoolteacher who ignores innovative teaching methods and sticks with her tried-and-true lesson plans. The veteran manager who is committed to doing things “his way.” The surgeon who dismisses the ideas of her younger colleagues. The band who produces a mind-blowing first album and then gets stuck in a rut. The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">One solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who </p></div>",

If you tie everything up in being the point guard or the partner at the firm or whatever else, then the loss of that facet of your life will wreck you. If you’re a vegan and then develop a health condition that forces you to change your diet, you’ll have an identity crisis on your hands.

When you spend your whole life defining yourself in one way and that disappears, who are you now? </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Military veterans and former entrepreneurs report similar feelings. If your identity is wrapped up in a belief like “I’m a great soldier,” what happens when your period of service ends? For many business owners, their identity is something along the lines of “I’m the CEO” or “I’m the founder.” If you have spent every waking moment working on your business, how will you feel after you sell the </p></div>",

Like water flowing around an obstacle, your identity works with the changing circumstances rather than against them. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The following quote from the <i>Tao Te Ching </i>encapsulates the ideas perfectly: </p><p class=\"x06-Verse-First\">Men are born soft and supple; </p><p class=\"x06-Verse\">dead, they are stiff and hard. </p><p class=\"x06-Verse\">Plants are born tender and pliant; </p><p class=\"x06-Verse\">dead, they are brittle and dry. </p><p class=\"x06-Verse\">Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible </p><p class=\"x06-Verse\">is a disciple of death. </p><p class=\"x06-Verse\">Whoever is soft and yielding </p><p class=\"x06-Verse\">is a disciple of life. </p><p class=\"x06-Verse\">The hard and stiff will be broken. </p><p class=\"x06-Verse\"></p></div>",

                    "In this section, I have compiled some lessons (and a few bits of common sense) that are confirmed by the model. The purpose of these examples is to clarify just how useful and wide-ranging this framework is when describing human behavior. Once you understand the model, you’ll see examples of it everywhere. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><b>Awareness comes before desire. </b>A craving is created when you assign meaning to a cue. Your brain constructs an emotion or feeling to describe your current situation, and that means a craving can only occur after you have noticed an opportunity. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><b></b></p></div>",
                    "Happiness is simply the absence of desire. </b>When you observe a <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_260\" title=\"260\">&nbsp;</span>cue, but do not desire to change your state, you are content with the current situation. Happiness is not about the achievement of pleasure (which is joy or satisfaction), but about the lack of desire. It arrives when you have no urge to feel differently. Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer want to change your state. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">However, happiness is fleeting because a new desire always comes along. As Caed Budris says, “ <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText245\">&nbsp;</span>Happiness is the space between one desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming.” Likewise, suffering </p></div>",
                    "is the space between craving a change in state and getting it. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><b>It is the </b><span class=\"BOLD_ITAL\">idea </span><b>of pleasure that we chase. </b>We seek the image of pleasure that we generate in our minds. At the time of action, we do not know what it will be like to attain that image (or even if it will satisfy us). The feeling of satisfaction only comes afterward. This is what the Austrian neurologist Victor Frankl meant when he said that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText246\">&nbsp;</span>happiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue. Desire is pursued. Pleasure ensues from action. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><b>Peace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into problems. </b></p></div>",
                    "The first step in any behavior is observation. You notice a cue, a bit of information, an event. If you do not desire to act on what you observe, then you are at peace. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Craving is about wanting to fix everything. Observation without craving is the realization that you do not need to fix anything. Your desires are not running rampant. You do not crave a change in state. Your mind does not generate a problem for you to solve. You’re simply observing and existing. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><b>With a big enough </b><span class=\"BOLD_ITAL\">why </span><b>you can overcome any </b><span class=\"BOLD_ITAL\">how </span><b>. </b>Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher and poet, famously wrote, “ <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText247\">&nbsp;</span>He who </p></div>",
                    "has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” This phrase harbors an important truth about human behavior. If your motivation and desire are great enough (that is, <i>why </i>are you are acting), you’ll take action <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_261\" title=\"261\">&nbsp;</span>even when it is quite difficult. Great craving can power great action—even when friction is high. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><b>Being curious is better than being smart. </b>Being motivated and curious counts for more than being smart because it leads to action. Being smart will never deliver results on its own because it doesn’t get you to act. It is desire, not intelligence, that prompts </p></div>",
                    "behavior. As Naval Ravikant says, “The trick to doing anything is first cultivating a desire for it.” </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><b>Emotions drive behavior. </b>Every decision is an emotional decision at some level. Whatever your logical reasons are for taking action, you only feel compelled to act on them because of emotion. In fact, people with damage to emotional centers of the brain can list many reasons for taking action but still will not act because they do not have emotions to drive them. This is why craving comes <i>before </i>response. The feeling comes first, and then the behavior. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><b>We can only be rational and logical </b><span class=\"BOLD_ITAL\"></span></p></div>",
                    "after </span><b>we have been emotional. </b>The primary mode of the brain is to feel; the secondary mode is to think. Our first response—the fast, nonconscious portion of the brain—is optimized for feeling and anticipating. Our second response—the slow, conscious portion of the brain—is the part that does the “thinking.” </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Psychologists refer to this as System 1 (feelings and rapid judgments) versus System 2 (rational analysis). <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText248\">&nbsp;</span>The feeling comes first (System 1); the rationality only intervenes later (System 2). This works great when the two are aligned, but it results in </p></div>",
                    "illogical and emotional thinking when they are not. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><b>Your response tends to follow your emotions. </b>Our thoughts and actions are rooted in what we find attractive, not necessarily in what is logical. Two people can notice the same set of facts and respond very differently because they run those facts through their unique emotional filter. This is one reason why <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText249\">&nbsp;</span>appealing to emotion is typically <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_262\" title=\"262\">&nbsp;</span>more powerful than appealing to reason. If a topic makes someone feel emotional, they will rarely be interested in the data. This is why emotions can be such a threat to wise decision </p></div>",
                    "making. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Put another way: most people believe that the reasonable response is the one that benefits them: the one that satisfies their desires. To approach a situation from a more neutral emotional position allows you to base your response on the data rather than the emotion. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><b>Suffering drives progress. </b>The source of all suffering is the desire for a change in state. This is also the source of all progress. The desire to change your state is what powers you to take action. It is wanting more that pushes humanity to seek improvements, </p></div>",
                    "develop new technologies, and reach for a higher level. With craving, we are dissatisfied but driven. Without craving, we are satisfied but lack ambition. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><b>Your actions reveal how badly you want something. </b>If you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really want it. It’s time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your actions reveal your true motivations. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><b>Reward is on the other side of sacrifice. </b>Response (sacrifice of energy) always precedes reward (the collection of resources). The “runner’s high” only comes after </p></div>",
                    "the hard run. The reward only comes after the energy is spent. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><b>Self-control is difficult because it is not satisfying. </b>A reward is an outcome that satisfies your craving. This makes self-control ineffective because inhibiting our desires does not usually resolve them. Resisting temptation does not satisfy your craving; it just ignores it. It creates space for the craving to pass. Self-control requires you to release a desire rather than satisfy it. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><b>Our expectations determine our satisfaction. </b>The gap between our cravings and our rewards determines how satisfied we feel </p></div>",
                    "after taking action. If the mismatch between expectations and outcomes is positive (surprise and delight), then we are more likely to repeat a <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_263\" title=\"263\">&nbsp;</span>behavior in the future. If the mismatch is negative (disappointment and frustration), then we are less likely to do so. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">For example, if you expect to get $10 and get $100, you feel great. If you expect to get $100 and get $10, you feel disappointed. Your expectation changes your satisfaction. An average experience preceded by high expectations is a disappointment. An average experience preceded by low expectations is a delight. </p></div>",

You’re perpetually putting more weight on the problem than the solution. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Happiness is relative. When I first began sharing my writing publicly it took me three months to get one thousand subscribers. When I hit that milestone, I told my parents and my girlfriend. We celebrated.

                    "years later, I realized that one thousand people were signing up each day. And yet I didn’t even think to tell anyone. It felt normal. I was getting results ninety times faster than before but experiencing little pleasure over it. It wasn’t until a few days later that I realized how absurd it was that I wasn’t celebrating something that would have seemed like a pipe dream just a few years before. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><b>The pain of failure correlates to the height of expectation. </b>When desire is high, it hurts to not <i>like </i>the outcome.

This is why people say, “I don’t want to get my hopes up.” </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><b>Feelings come both before and after the behavior. </b>Before acting, there is a feeling that motivates you to act—the craving. After acting, <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_264\" title=\"264\">&nbsp;</span>there is a feeling that teaches you to repeat the action in the future—the reward. </p><p class=\"x06-Extract-1P\">Cue &gt; Craving (Feeling) &gt; Response &gt; Reward (Feeling) </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">How we feel influences how we act, and how we act influences how we feel. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><b>Desire initiates.

                    "desirable, you have no reason to do it. Desire and craving are what initiate a behavior. But if it’s not enjoyable, you have no reason to repeat it. Pleasure and satisfaction are what sustain a behavior. Feeling motivated gets you to act. Feeling successful gets you to repeat. </p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><b>Hope declines with experience and is replaced by acceptance. </b>The first time an opportunity arises, there is hope of what could be. Your expectation (cravings) is based solely on <i>promise </i>. The second time around, your expectation is grounded in reality. You begin to understand how the process works </p></div>",

By the dawn of the new decade in 1950, Professor H. G. Landau of the University of Chicago was turning his mind to what it was that made animals form themselves into hierarchies. Most species, from hens to humans, organise themselves like this, and Landau’s question was, why? </span></div><div class=\"p-indent\"><span>With Adolf Hitler barely five years dead, the Third Reich’s toxic hierarchies could not have been far from the minds of the committee </span></div></div></div>",

If my emotional power over you inclines me to see you as an object under my control, then it is inevitable that my behaviour towards you will deteriorate, in the absence of empathy as a corrective.

In 1922, the psychiatrist Carl Jung chose this spot to begin building a retreat. He began with a basic two-story stone house he called the Tower. After returning from a trip to India, where he observed the practice of adding meditation rooms to homes, he expanded the complex to include a private office. “In my retiring room I am by myself,” Jung said of the space. “I keep the key with me all the time; no one else is allowed in </p></section></div>",
                    "there except with my permission.” </p><p>In his book <em>Daily Rituals </em>, journalist Mason Currey sorted through various sources on Jung to re-create the psychiatrist’s work habits at the Tower. Jung would rise at seven a.m., Currey reports, and after a big breakfast he would spend two hours of undistracted writing time in his private office. His afternoons would often consist of meditation or long walks in the surrounding countryside. There was no electricity at the Tower, so as day gave way to night, light came from oil lamps and heat from the fireplace. Jung would retire <span id=\"page-2\">&nbsp;</span>to bed by ten p.m. “The feeling of </p></section></div>",

In 1922, when Jung bought the property, he could not afford to take a vacation. Only one year earlier, in 1921, he had published <em>Psychological Types </em>, a seminal book that solidified many differences that had been long developing between Jung’s thinking and the ideas of his </p></section></div>",

But he wasn’t satisfied with busyness alone. He wanted to change the way we understood the unconscious, and this goal required deeper, more careful thought than he could manage </p></section></div>",

We now know from decades of research in both psychology and neuroscience that the state of mental strain that accompanies deep work is also necessary to improve your abilities. Deep work, in other words, was exactly the type of effort needed to stand out in a cognitively demanding field like academic psychiatry in the early twentieth century. </p><p>The term “deep work” is my own </p></section></div>",

Jung built a tower out of stone in the woods to promote deep work in his professional life—a task that required time, energy, and money. It also took him away from more immediate pursuits. As Mason Currey writes, Jung’s regular journeys to Bollingen reduced the time he spent on his clinical work, noting, “Although he had many patients who relied on him, Jung was not shy about taking time off.” Deep work, though a burden to </p></section></div>",

Here’s how he once explained the omission: “If I organize my life in such a way that I get lots of long, consecutive, uninterrupted time-chunks, I can write novels.

He specializes in ancient and medieval metalworking practices, which he painstakingly re-creates in his shop, Door County Forgeworks. “I do all my work by hand and use tools that multiply my force without limiting my creativity or interaction with the material,” he explains in his artist’s statement. “What may take me 100 blows by hand can be accomplished in one by a large swaging machine.

We learn that he works in a converted barn in Wisconsin farm country, not far inland from the scenic Sturgeon Bay of Lake Michigan. Furrer often leaves the barn doors open (to vent the heat of the forges, one suspects), his efforts framed by farm fields stretching to the horizon. The setting is idyllic but the work can seem, at first encounter, brutish. In the documentary, Furrer is trying to re-create a Viking-era sword. He begins by using a fifteen-hundred-year-old </p></section></div>",

This dense ingot must then be shaped and polished into a long and elegant sword blade. </p><p>“This part, the initial breakdown, is terrible,” Furrer says to the camera as he methodically heats the ingot, hits it with a hammer, turns it, hits it, then puts it back in the flames to start over. The narrator reveals that it will take <em>eight hours </em>of this hammering to complete the shaping. As you watch Furrer work, however, the sense of the labor </p></section></div>",
                    "shifts. It becomes clear that he’s not drearily whacking at the metal like a miner with a pickaxe: Every hit, though forceful, is carefully controlled. He peers intently at the metal, through thin-framed intellectual glasses (which seem out of place perched above his heavy beard and broad shoulders), turning it <em>just so </em>for each impact. “You have to be very gentle with it or you will crack it,” he explains. After a few more hammer strikes, he adds: “You have to nudge it; slowly it breaks down; then you start to enjoy it.” </p><p>At one point about halfway through the smithing, after Furrer has </p></section></div>",
                    "finished hammering out the desired shape, he begins rotating the metal carefully in a narrow trough of burning charcoal. As he stares at the blade something clicks: “It’s ready.” He lifts the sword, red with heat, holding it away from his body as he strides swiftly toward a pipe filled with oil and plunges in the blade to cool it. After a moment of relief that the blade did not crack into pieces—a common occurrence at this step—Furrer pulls it from the oil. The residual heat of the metal lights the fuel, engulfing the <span id=\"page-74\">&nbsp;</span>sword’s full length in yellow flames. Furrer holds the burning sword up above </p></section></div>",

As elaborated in the last chapter, we live in an era where anything Internet related is understood by default to be innovative and necessary. Depth-destroying behaviors such as immediate e-mail responses and an active social media presence are lauded, while avoidance of these trends generates suspicion.

From this perspective, the small-scale details of how you spend your day aren’t that important, because what matters are the large-scale outcomes, such as whether or not you get a promotion or move to that nicer apartment. According to Gallagher, decades of research contradict this understanding. Our brains instead construct our worldview based on <em>what we pay attention to </em>.

At the time, it was difficult <span id=\"page-83\">&nbsp;</span>to accurately measure the psychological impact of different activities. If you brought someone into a laboratory and asked her to remember how she felt at a specific point many hours ago, she was unlikely to recall. If you instead gave her a diary and asked her to record how she felt throughout the day, she wouldn’t be likely to keep up the entries with diligence—it’s simply too much work. </p><p>Csikszentmihalyi and Larson’s breakthrough was to leverage new </p></section></div>",
                    "technology (for the time) to bring the question to the subject right when it mattered. In more detail, they outfitted experimental subjects with pagers. These pagers would beep at randomly selected intervals (in modern incarnations of this method, smartphone apps play the same role). When the beeper went off, the subjects would record what they were doing at the exact moment and how they felt. In some cases, they would be provided with a journal in which to record this information while in others they would be given a phone number to call to answer questions posed by a field-worker. </p></section></div>",
                    "Because the beeps were only occasional but hard to ignore, the subjects were likely to follow through with the experimental procedure. And because the subjects were recording responses about an activity <em>at the very moment </em>they were engaged in it, the responses were more accurate. Csikszentmihalyi and Larson called the approach the experience sampling method (ESM), and it provided unprecedented insight into how we actually feel about the beats of our daily lives. </p><p>Among many breakthroughs, Csikszentmihalyi’s work with ESM helped validate a theory he had </p></section></div>",

At the time, this finding pushed back against conventional wisdom. Most people assumed (and still do) that relaxation makes them happy. We want to work less and spend more time in the hammock.

Both point toward the importance of depth over shallowness, but they focus on two different explanations <span id=\"page-85\">&nbsp;</span>for this importance.

                    "for more than four decades, and Sean Dorrance Kelly, who at the time of this writing is the chair of Harvard’s philosophy department. In 2011, Dreyfus and Kelly published a book, <em>All Things Shining </em>, which explores how notions of sacredness and meaning have evolved throughout the history of human culture. They set out to reconstruct this history because they’re worried about its endpoint in our current era. “The world used to be, in its various forms, a world of sacred, shining things,” Dreyfus and Kelly explain early in the book. “The shining things now seem far away.” </p><p>What happened between then and </p></section></div>",
                    "now? The short answer, the authors argue, is Descartes. From Descartes’s skepticism came the radical belief that the individual seeking certainty trumped a God or king bestowing truth. The resulting Enlightenment, of course, led to the concept <span id=\"page-87\">&nbsp;</span>of human rights and freed many from oppression. But as Dreyfus and Kelly emphasize, for all its good in the political arena, in the domain of the metaphysical this thinking stripped the world of the order and sacredness essential to creating meaning.

This connection should seem less surprising when it’s revealed that Dreyfus and Kelly’s </p></section></div>",
                    "response to modern nihilism builds on the very subject that opened this chapter: the craftsman. </p><p>Craftsmanship, Dreyfus and Kelly argue in their book’s conclusion, provides a key to reopening a sense of sacredness in a responsible manner. To illustrate this claim, they use as an organizing example an account of a master wheelwright—the now lost profession of shaping wooden wagon wheels. “Because each piece of wood is distinct, it has its own personality,” they write after a passage describing the details of the wheelwright’s craft. “The woodworker has an intimate </p></section></div>",

Its subtle virtues call out to be cultivated and cared for.” In this appreciation for the “subtle <span id=\"page-88\">&nbsp;</span>virtues” of his medium, they note, the craftsman has stumbled onto something crucial in a post-Enlightenment world: a source of meaning sited outside the individual. The wheelwright doesn’t decide arbitrarily which virtues of the wood he works are valuable and which are not; this value is inherent in the wood and the task it’s meant to perform. </p><p>As Dreyfus and Kelly explain, such sacredness is common to craftsmanship. The task of a </p></section></div>",
                    "craftsman, they conclude, “is not to <em>generate </em>meaning, but rather to <em>cultivate </em>in himself the skill of <em>discerning </em>the meanings that are <em>already there </em>.” This frees the craftsman of the nihilism of autonomous individualism, providing an ordered world of meaning. At the same time, this meaning seems safer than the sources cited in previous eras. The wheelwright, the authors imply, cannot easily use the inherent quality of a piece of pine to justify a despotic monarchy. </p><p class=\"orn\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"space-break\">Returning to the question of professional satisfaction, Dreyfus </p></section></div>",

                    "Beautiful code is short and concise, so if you were to give that code to another programmer they would say, “oh, that’s well written code.” It’s much like as if you were writing a poem. </em></p></div><p>Gonzalez discusses computer programming similarly to the way woodworkers discuss their craft in the passages quoted by Dreyfus and Kelly. </p><p><em>The Pragmatic Programmer </em>, a well-regarded book in the computer programming field, makes this connection between code and old-style craftsmanship more directly by quoting the medieval quarry worker’s creed in </p></section></div>",
                    "its preface: “We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.” The book then elaborates that computer programmers must see their work in the same way: </p><div class=\"blockquote\"><p class=\"blockquote-firstparal\"><em>Within the overall structure of a project there is always room for individuality and craftsmanship… One hundred years from now, our engineering may seem as <span id=\"page-90\">&nbsp;</span>archaic as the techniques used by medieval cathedral builders seem to today’s civil engineers, while our craftsmanship will still be honored. </em></p></div><p>You don’t, in other words, need to be toiling in an open-air barn for your efforts to be considered the </p></section></div>",
                    "type of craftsmanship that can generate Dreyfus and Kelly’s meaning. A similar potential for craftsmanship can be found in most skilled jobs in the information economy. Whether you’re a writer, marketer, consultant, or lawyer: Your work is craft, and if you hone your ability and apply it with respect and care, then like the skilled wheelwright you can generate meaning in the daily efforts of your professional life. </p><p>It’s here that some might respond that <em>their </em>knowledge work job cannot possibly become such a source of meaning because their job’s subject is much too mundane. </p></section></div>",
                    "But this is flawed thinking that our consideration of traditional craftsmanship can help correct. In our current culture, we place a lot of emphasis on job description. Our obsession with the advice to “follow your passion” (the subject of my last book), for example, is motivated by the (flawed) idea that what matters most for your career satisfaction is the specifics of the job you choose. In this way of thinking, there are some rarified jobs that can be a source of satisfaction—perhaps working in a nonprofit or starting a software company—while all others are soulless and bland. The philosophy </p></section></div>",
                    "of Dreyfus and Kelly frees us from such traps. The craftsmen they cite don’t have rarified jobs. Throughout most of human history, to be a blacksmith or a wheelwright wasn’t glamorous. But <span id=\"page-91\">&nbsp;</span>this doesn’t matter, as the specifics of the work are irrelevant. The meaning uncovered by such efforts is due to the skill and appreciation inherent in craftsmanship—not the outcomes of their work.

You don’t need a rarified job; you need instead a rarified approach to your work. </p><p>The second key observation about </p></section></div>",

Deep work, therefore, is key to extracting meaning from your profession in the manner described by Dreyfus and Kelly. It follows that to embrace deep work in your own career, and to direct it toward cultivating your skill, is an effort that can transform a knowledge work job from a distracted, draining obligation into </p></section></div>",

Dewane is an architecture professor, and therefore likes to explore the intersection between the conceptual and the concrete. The Eudaimonia Machine is a good example of this intersection. The machine, which takes its name from the ancient Greek concept of <em>eudaimonia </em>(a state in which you’re achieving your full human potential), turns out to be a </p></section></div>",
                    "building. “The goal of the machine,” David explained, “is to create a setting where the users can get into a state of deep human flourishing—creating work that’s at the absolute extent of their personal abilities.” It is, in other words, a space designed for the sole purpose of enabling the deepest possible deep work. I was, as you might expect, intrigued. </p><p>As Dewane explained the machine to me, he grabbed a pen to sketch its proposed layout. The structure is a one-story narrow rectangle made up of five rooms, placed in a line, one after another. There’s no shared hallway: you have to pass </p></section></div>",
                    "through one room to get to the next. As Dewane explains, “[The lack of circulation] is critical because it doesn’t allow <span id=\"page-96\">&nbsp;</span>you to bypass any of the spaces as you get deeper into the machine.” </p><p>The first room you enter when coming off the street is called the gallery. In Dewane’s plan, this room would contain examples of deep work produced in the building. It’s meant to inspire users of the machine, creating a “culture of healthy stress and peer pressure.” </p><p>As you leave the gallery, you next enter the salon. In here, Dewane imagines access to high-quality coffee and perhaps even a full bar. </p></section></div>",
                    "There are also couches and Wi-Fi. The salon is designed to create a mood that “hovers between intense curiosity and argumentation.” This is a place to debate, “brood,” and in general work through the ideas that you’ll develop deeper in the machine. </p><p>Beyond the salon you enter the library. This room stores a permanent record of all work produced in the machine, as well as the books and other resources used in this previous work. There will be copiers and scanners for gathering and collecting the information you need for your project. Dewane describes the </p></section></div>",
                    "library as “the hard drive of the machine.” </p><p>The next room is the office space. It contains a standard conference room with a whiteboard and some cubicles with desks. “The office,” Dewane explains, “is for low-intensity activity.” To use our terminology, this is the space to complete the shallow efforts required by your project. Dewane imagines an administrator with a desk in the office who could help its users improve their work habits to optimize their efficiency. </p><p>This brings us to the final room of the machine, a collection of what Dewane calls “deep work </p></section></div>",
                    "chambers” (he <span id=\"page-97\">&nbsp;</span>adopted the term “deep work” from my articles on the topic). Each chamber is conceived to be six by ten feet and protected by thick soundproof walls (Dewane’s plans call for eighteen inches of insulation). “The purpose of the deep work chamber is to allow for total focus and uninterrupted work flow,” Dewane explains. He imagines a process in which you spend ninety minutes inside, take a ninety-minute break, and repeat two or three times—at which point your brain will have achieved its limit of concentration for the day. </p><p>For now, the Eudaimonia Machine </p></section></div>",
                    "exists only as a collection of architectural drawings, but even as a plan, its potential to support impactful work excites Dewane. “[This design] remains, in my mind, the most interesting piece of architecture I’ve ever produced,” he told me. </p><p class=\"orn\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"space-break\">In an ideal world—one in which the true value of deep work is accepted and celebrated—we’d all have access to something like the Eudaimonia Machine.

                    "people recognize that this urge can complicate efforts to concentrate on hard things, but most underestimate its regularity and strength. </p><p>Consider a 2012 study, led by psychologists Wilhelm Hofmann and Roy Baumeister, that outfitted 205 adults with beepers that activated at randomly selected times (this is the experience sampling method discussed in Part 1).

                    "about these desires. After a week, the researchers had gathered more than 7,500 samples. Here’s the short version of what they found: <em>People fight desires all day long </em>. As Baumeister summarized in his subsequent book, <em>Willpower </em>(co-authored with the science writer John Tierney): “Desire turned out to be the norm, not the exception.” </p><p>The five most common desires these subjects fought include, not surprisingly, eating, sleeping, and sex. But the top five list also included desires for “taking a break from [hard] work… checking e-mail and social networking sites, surfing </p></section></div>",
                    "the web, listening to music, or watching television.” The lure of the Internet and television proved especially strong: The subjects succeeded in resisting these particularly addictive distractions only around half the time. </p><p>These results are bad news for this rule’s goal of helping you cultivate a deep work habit. They tell us that you can expect to be bombarded with the desire to do anything <em>but </em>work deeply throughout the day, and if you’re like the German subjects from the Hofmann and Baumeister study, these competing desires will often win out. You might respond at this point that <em>you </em>will </p></section></div>",
                    "succeed where these subjects failed because you understand the importance of depth and will therefore be more rigorous in your will to remain concentrated. This is a noble sentiment, but the decades of research that preceded this study underscore its futility. A now voluminous line of inquiry, initiated in a series of pioneering papers also written by Roy Baumeister, has established the following important (and at the time, unexpected) <span id=\"page-100\">&nbsp;</span>truth about willpower: <em>You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it </em>. </p><p>Your will, in other words, is not a manifestation of your character </p></section></div>",

Such attempts will therefore frequently fail.

                    "Depth Philosophy </h1><p class=\"noindent\">The famed computer scientist Donald Knuth cares about deep work. As he explains on his website: “What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration.” A doctoral candidate named Brian Chappell, who is a father with a full-time job, also values deep work, as it’s the only way he can make progress on his dissertation given his limited time. Chappell told me that his first encounter with the idea of deep work was “an emotional moment.” </p><p>I mention these examples because although Knuth and Chappell agree on the importance of depth, </p></section></div>",
                    "they disagree on their <em>philosophies </em>for integrating this depth into their work lives. As I’ll detail in the next section, Knuth deploys a form of monasticism that prioritizes deep work by trying <span id=\"page-102\">&nbsp;</span>to eliminate or minimize all other types of work. Chappell, by contrast, deploys a rhythmic strategy in which he works for the same hours (five to seven thirty a.m.) every weekday morning, without exception, before beginning a workday punctuated by standard distractions. Both approaches work, but not universally. Knuth’s approach might make sense for someone whose primary professional </p></section></div>",

He decided to disconnect from his online life for twenty-five days: no Facebook, no Twitter, no Foursquare (a service that awarded him “Mayor of the Year” in 2011), not even e-mail. He needed the break. Thurston, who is described by friends as “the most connected man in the world,” had by his own count participated in more than fifty-nine thousand Gmail conversations and posted </p></section></div>",
                    "fifteen hundred times on his Facebook wall in the year leading up to his experiment. “I was burnt out. Fried. Done. Toast,” he explained. </p><p>We know about Thurston’s experiment because he wrote about it in a cover article for <em>Fast Company </em>magazine, ironically titled “#UnPlug.” As Thurston reveals in the article, it didn’t take long to adjust to a disconnected life. “By the end of that first week, the quiet rhythm of my days seemed far less strange,” he said. “I was less stressed about not knowing new things; I felt that I still existed despite not having shared </p></section></div>",
                    "documentary evidence of said existence on the Internet.” Thurston struck up conversations with strangers. He <span id=\"page-182\">&nbsp;</span>enjoyed food without Instagramming the experience. He bought a bike (“turns out it’s easier to ride the thing when you’re not trying to simultaneously check your Twitter”). “The end came too soon,” Thurston lamented. But he had start-ups to run and books to market, so after the twenty-five days passed, he reluctantly reactivated his online presence. </p><p>Baratunde Thurston’s experiment neatly summarizes two important points about our culture’s current relationship with social networks </p></section></div>",
                    "like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and infotainment sites like Business Insider and BuzzFeed—two categories of online distraction that I will collectively call “network tools” in the pages ahead. The first point is that we increasingly recognize that these tools fragment our time and reduce our ability to concentrate. This reality no longer generates much debate; we all feel it. This is a real problem for many different people, but the problem is especially dire if you’re attempting to improve your ability to work deeply. In the preceding rule, for example, I described several </p></section></div>",

These efforts will become significantly more difficult if you simultaneously behave like a pre-experiment Baratunde Thurston, allowing your life outside such training to remain a distracted blur of apps and browser tabs. Willpower is limited, and therefore the more enticing tools you have pulling at your attention, the harder it’ll be to maintain focus on something important. To master the art of deep work, therefore, you must take back control of your time and attention from the many diversions that attempt to steal them. </p><p><span id=\"page-183\"></span></p></section></div>",
                    "&nbsp;</span>Before we begin fighting back against these distractions, however, we must better understand the battlefield. This brings me to the second important point summarized by Baratunde Thurston’s story: the impotence with which knowledge workers currently discuss this problem of network tools and attention. Overwhelmed by these tools’ demands on his time, Thurston felt that his only option was to (temporarily) quit the Internet altogether. This idea that a drastic <em>Internet sabbatical </em><span href=\"footnotes.xhtml#fn0011fn\" id=\"fn0011\"><sup>* </sup></span>is the only alternative to the distraction generated by social media and </p></section></div>",

In the fall of 2013, I received insight into this process because of an article I wrote explaining why I never joined Facebook. Though the piece was meant to be explanatory and not accusatory, it nonetheless put many readers on the defensive, leading them to reply with justifications for <em>their </em>use of the service.

[Once] there I improved my writing and made very good friends.” </p><p class=\"bl-list\">• “[I use] Facebook because a lot of people I knew in high school are on there.” </p></div><p>Here’s what strikes me about these responses (which are representative of the large amount </p></section></div>",
                    "of feedback I received on this topic): They’re surprisingly minor. I don’t doubt, for example, that the first commenter from this list finds some entertainment in using Facebook, but I would also assume that this person wasn’t suffering some severe deficit of entertainment options before he or she signed up for the service. I would further wager that this user would succeed in staving off boredom even if the service were suddenly shut down. Facebook, at best, added one more (arguably quite mediocre) entertainment option to many that already existed. </p><p></p></section></div>",

Something similar can be said <span id=\"page-186\">&nbsp;</span>about the commenter who reconnected with high school friends: This is a nice diversion, but hardly something central to his or her sense of social connection or happiness. </p><p></p></section></div>",

Eventually, if you use these tools enough, you’ll arrive at the state of burned-out, hyperdistracted connectivity that <span id=\"page-187\">&nbsp;</span>plagued Baratunde Thurston and millions of others like him. It’s here that we encounter the true insidious nature of an any-benefit mind-set. The use of network tools can be harmful. If you don’t attempt to weigh pros against cons, but instead use any glimpse of some potential benefit as justification for unrestrained use of a tool, then you’re unwittingly crippling your ability to succeed in the world of knowledge work. </p><p></p></section></div>",
                    "This conclusion, if considered objectively, shouldn’t be surprising. In the context of network tools, we’ve become comfortable with the any-benefit mind-set, but if we instead zoom out and consider this mind-set in the broader context of skilled labor, it suddenly seems a bizarre and ahistorical approach to choosing tools. In other words, once you put aside the revolutionary rhetoric surrounding all things Internet—the sense, summarized in Part 1, that you’re either fully committed to “the revolution” or a Luddite curmudgeon—you’ll soon realize that network tools are not exceptional; they’re tools, no </p></section></div>",

Throughout history, skilled laborers have applied sophistication and skepticism to their encounters with new tools and their decisions about whether to adopt them.

                    "it makes sense to start by talking to someone who makes a living working with (nondigital) tools and <span id=\"page-188\">&nbsp;</span>relies on a complex relationship with these tools to succeed.

Haymaking is done with a piece of equipment called a hay baler: a device you pull behind a tractor that compresses and binds dried grass into bales. If you raise animals on the East Coast there’s an obvious reason to own and operate a hay baler: Your animals need hay. Why spend money to “buy in” feed when you have perfectly good grass growing for free right in your own soil? If a farmer subscribed to the any-benefit approach used by </p></section></div>",
                    "knowledge workers, therefore, he would definitely buy a hay baler. But as Pritchard explained to me (after preemptively apologizing for a moment of snark), if a farmer actually adopted such a simplistic mind-set, “I’d be counting the days until the ‘For Sale’ sign goes up on the property.” Pritchard, like most practitioners of his trade, instead deploys a more sophisticated thought process when assessing tools. And after applying this process to the hay baler, Pritchard was quick to sell it: Smith Meadows now purchases all the hay it uses. </p><p><em>Here’s why… </em></p><p>“Let’s start by exploring the costs of </p></section></div>",
                    "making hay,” Pritchard said. “First, there’s the actual cost of fuel, and repairs, and the shed to keep the baler. You also have to pay taxes on it.” These directly measurable costs, however, were the easy part of his decision. It was instead the “opportunity costs” that required more attention. As he elaborated: “If I make hay all summer, I can’t be doing something else. For example, I now use that time instead to raise boilers [chickens <span id=\"page-190\">&nbsp;</span>meant for eating]. These generate positive cash flow, because I can sell them. But they also produce manure which I can then use to enhance my soil.” Then there’s the equally </p></section></div>",
                    "subtle issue of assessing the secondary value of a purchased bale of hay. As Pritchard explained: “When I’m buying in hay, I’m trading cash for animal protein, as well as manure (once it passes through the animals’ system), which means I am also getting more nutrients for my land in exchange for my money. I’m also avoiding compacting soils by driving heavy machinery over my ground all summer long.” </p><p>When making his final decision on the baler, Pritchard moved past the direct monetary costs, which were essentially a wash, and instead shifted his attention to the more </p></section></div>",
                    "nuanced issue of the long-term health of his fields. For the reasons described previously, Pritchard concluded that buying in hay results in healthier fields. And as he summarized: “Soil fertility is my baseline.” By this calculation, the baler had to go. </p><p>Notice the complexity of Pritchard’s tool decision. This complexity underscores an important reality: The notion that identifying <em>some </em>benefit is sufficient to invest money, time, and attention in a tool is near laughable to people in his trade. <em>Of course </em>a hay baler offers benefits— <em>every </em>tool at the farm supply store has something useful </p></section></div>",

Professors—especially junior professors—are notorious for adopting grueling schedules that extend into the night and through weekends. Consider, for example, a blog post published by a young computer science professor whom I’ll call “Tom.” In this post, which Tom wrote in the winter of 2014, he replicates his schedule for a recent day in which he spent <span id=\"page-237\">&nbsp;</span>twelve hours at his office. This schedule includes </p></section></div>",
                    "five different meetings and three hours of “administrative” tasks, which he describes as “tending to bushels of e-mails, filling out bureaucratic forms, organizing meeting notes, planning future meetings.” By his estimation, he spent only <em>one and a half </em>out of the twelve total hours sitting in his office tackling “real” work, which he defines as efforts that make progress toward a “research deliverable.” It’s no wonder that Tom feels coerced into working well beyond the standard workday. “I’ve already accepted the reality that I’ll be working on weekends,” he concludes in another post. “Very </p></section></div>",

Even though I don’t work at night and rarely work on weekends, between arriving at Georgetown in the fall of 2011 and beginning work on this chapter in the fall of 2014, I’ve published somewhere around twenty peer-reviewed articles. I also won two competitive grants, published one (nonacademic) book, and have almost finished writing another (which you’re reading at the moment). All while avoiding the grueling schedules deemed necessary by the Toms of the world. </p><p></p></section></div>",
                    "What explains this paradox? We can find a compelling answer in a widely disseminated article published in 2013 by an academic further along in her career, and far more accomplished than I: Radhika Nagpal, the Fred Kavli Professor of Computer Science at Harvard University. Nagpal opens the article by claiming that much of the stress suffered by tenure-track professors is self-imposed. “Scary myths and scary data abound about life as a tenure-track faculty at an <span id=\"page-238\">&nbsp;</span>‘R1’ [research-focused] university,” she begins, before continuing to explain how she finally decided to disregard the conventional wisdom </p></section></div>",

As Nagpal admits, early in her academic career she found herself trying to cram work into every free hour between seven a.m. and midnight (because she has kids, this time, especially in the evening, was often severely fractured). It didn’t take long before she decided this strategy was unsustainable, so she </p></section></div>",

How did she pull this off?

                    "example, she decided she would travel only five times per year for any purpose, as trips can generate a surprisingly large load of urgent shallow obligations (from making lodging arrangements to writing talks). Five trips a year may still sound like a lot, but for an academic it’s light. To emphasize this point, note that Matt Welsh, a former colleague of Nagpal in the Harvard <span id=\"page-239\">&nbsp;</span>computer science department (he now works for Google) once wrote a blog post in which he claimed it was typical for junior faculty to travel twelve to twenty-four times a year.

                    "in sidestepping an extra ten to fifteen trips!) The travel quota is just one of several tactics that Nagpal used to control her workday (she also, for example, placed limits on the number of papers she would review per year), but what all her tactics shared was a commitment to ruthlessly capping the shallow while protecting the deep efforts—that is, original research—that ultimately determined her professional fate. </p><p>Returning to my own example, it’s a similar commitment that enables me to succeed with fixed scheduling. I, too, am incredibly cautious about my use of the most </p></section></div>",
                    "dangerous word in one’s productivity vocabulary: “yes.” It takes a lot to convince me to agree to something that yields shallow work. If you ask for my involvement in university business that’s not absolutely necessary, I might respond with a defense I learned from the department chair who hired me: “Talk to me after tenure.” Another tactic that works well for me is to be clear in my refusal but ambiguous in my explanation for the refusal. The key is to avoid providing enough specificity about the excuse that the requester has the opportunity to defuse it. If, for example, I turn down a </p></section></div>",
                    "time-consuming speaking invitation with the excuse that I have other trips scheduled for around the same time, I don’t provide details—which might leave the requester the ability to suggest a way to fit his or her event into my existing obligations—but instead just say, “Sounds interesting, but <span id=\"page-240\">&nbsp;</span>I can’t make it due to schedule conflicts.” In turning down obligations, I also resist the urge to offer a consolation prize that ends up devouring almost as much of my schedule (e.g., “Sorry I can’t join your committee, but I’m happy to take a look at some of your proposals as they come together </p></section></div>",
                    "and offer my thoughts”). A clean break is best. </p><p>In addition to carefully guarding my obligations, I’m incredibly conscientious about managing my time. Because my time is limited each day, I cannot afford to allow a large deadline to creep up on me, or a morning to be wasted on something trivial, because I didn’t take a moment to craft a smart plan. The Damoclean cap on the workday enforced by fixed-schedule productivity has a way of keeping my organization efforts sharp. Without this looming cutoff, I’d likely end up more lax in my habits. </p><p></p></section></div>",
                    "To summarize these observations, Nagpal and I can both succeed in academia without Tom-style overload due to two reasons. First, we’re asymmetric in the culling forced by our fixed-schedule commitment. By ruthlessly reducing the shallow while preserving the deep, this strategy frees up our time without diminishing the amount of new value we generate. Indeed, I would go so far as to argue that the reduction in shallow frees up <em>more </em>energy for the deep alternative, allowing us to produce more than if we had defaulted to a more typical crowded schedule. Second, the </p></section></div>",

That is, even if you’re not a professor, fixed-schedule productivity can yield powerful benefits.

It might also lead you to test assumptions about your company’s work culture that you thought were ironclad but turn out to be malleable. It’s common, for example, to receive e-mails from your boss after hours. </p></section></div>",

                    "logistical challenges like setting up a coffee meeting (Example #1). I then took a minute or two to think through a process that gets us from the current state to a desired outcome with a minimum of messages required. The final step was to write a reply that clearly describes this process and where we stand. These examples centered on an e-mail reply, but it should be clear that a similar approach also works when writing an e-mail message from scratch. </p><p><span id=\"page-252\">&nbsp;</span>The process-centric approach to e-mail can significantly mitigate the impact of this technology on your time and attention.

First, it reduces the number of e-mails in your inbox—sometimes significantly (something as simple as scheduling a coffee meeting can easily spiral into half a dozen or more messages over a period of many days, if you’re not careful about your replies). This, in turn, reduces the time you spend in your inbox and reduces the brainpower you must expend when you do. </p><p>Second, to steal terminology from David Allen, a good process-centric message immediately “closes the loop” with respect to the project at hand.

This method closes this open loop as soon as it forms. By working through the whole process, adding to your task lists and calendar any relevant commitments on your part, and bringing the other party up to speed, your mind can reclaim the mental real estate the project once demanded. Less mental clutter means more mental resources available for deep thinking. </p><p></p></section></div>",
                    "Process-centric e-mails might not seem natural at first. For one thing, they require that you spend more time thinking about your messages before you compose them. In the moment, this might seem like you’re spending <em>more </em>time on e-mail. But the important point to remember is that the extra two to three minutes you spend at this point will save you <span id=\"page-253\">&nbsp;</span>many more minutes reading and responding to unnecessary extra messages later. </p><p>The other issue is that process-centric messages can seem stilted and overly technical. The current social conventions surrounding e-mail promote a conversational </p></section></div>",
                    "tone that clashes with the more systematic schedules or decision trees commonly used in process-centric communication. If this concerns you, I suggest that you add a longer conversational preamble to your messages. You can even separate the process-centric portion of the message from the conversational opening with a divider line, or label it “Proposed Next Steps,” so that its technical tone seems more appropriate in context. </p><p>In the end, these minor hassles are worth it.

In the winter of 1974, a young Harvard student named Bill Gates sees the Altair, the world’s first personal computer, on the cover of <em>Popular Electronics </em>. Gates realizes that there’s an opportunity to design software for the machine, so he drops everything and with the help of Paul Allen and Monte Davidoff spends the next eight weeks hacking together a version of the BASIC programming language for the Altair. This story is often cited </p></section></div>",
                    "as an example of Gates’s insight and boldness, but recent interviews have revealed another trait that played a crucial role in the tale’s happy ending: Gates’s preternatural deep work ability. </p><p>As Walter Isaacson explained in a 2013 article on the topic for the <em>Harvard Gazette </em>, Gates worked with such intensity for such lengths during this two-month stretch that he would often collapse into sleep on his keyboard in the middle of writing a line of code. He would then sleep for an hour or two, wake up, and pick up right where he left off—an ability that a still-impressed Paul Allen describes <span id=\"page-258\">&nbsp;</span>as </p></section></div>",
                    "“a prodigious feat of concentration.” In his book <em>The Innovators </em>, Isaacson later summarized Gates’s unique tendency toward depth as follows: “The one trait that differentiated [Gates from Allen] was focus. Allen’s mind would flit between many ideas and passions, but Gates was a serial obsessor.” </p><p>It’s here, in this story of Gates’s obsessive focus, that we encounter the strongest form of my argument for deep work. It’s easy, amid the turbulence of a rapidly evolving information age, to default to dialectical grumbling. The curmudgeons among us are </p></section></div>",
                    "vaguely uneasy about the attention people pay to their phones, and pine for the days of unhurried concentration, while the digital hipsters equate such nostalgia with Luddism and boredom, and believe that increased connection is the foundation for a utopian future. Marshall McLuhan declared that “the medium is the message,” but our current conversation on these topics seems to imply that “the medium is morality”—either you’re on board with the Facebook future or see it as our downfall. </p><p>As I emphasized in this book’s introduction, I have no interest in </p></section></div>",
                    "this debate. A commitment to deep work is not a moral stance and it’s not a philosophical statement—it is instead a pragmatic recognition that the ability to concentrate is a skill that <em>gets valuable things done </em>. Deep work is important, in other words, not because distraction is evil, but because it enabled Bill Gates to start a billion-dollar industry in less than a semester. </p><p>This is also a lesson, as it turns out, that I’ve personally relearned again and again in my own career. I’ve been a depth <span id=\"page-259\">&nbsp;</span>devotee for more than a decade, but even I am still regularly surprised by its power. When I was in graduate school, the </p></section></div>",
                    "period when I first encountered and started prioritizing this skill, I found that deep work allowed me to write a pair of quality peer-reviewed papers each year (a respectable rate for a student), while rarely having to work past five on weekdays or work at all on weekends (a rarity among my peers). </p><p>As I neared my transition to professorship, however, I began to worry. As a student and a postdoc my time commitments were minimal—leaving me most of my day to shape as I desired. I knew I would lose this luxury in the next phase of my career, and I wasn’t </p></section></div>",
                    "confident in my ability to integrate enough deep work into this more demanding schedule to maintain my productivity. Instead of just stewing in my anxiety, I decided to do something about it: I created a plan to bolster my deep work muscles. </p><p>These training efforts were deployed during my last two years at MIT, while I was a postdoc starting to look for professor positions. My main tactic was to introduce artificial constraints on my schedule, so as to better approximate the more limited free time I expected as a professor. In addition to my rule about not </p></section></div>",
                    "working at night, I started to take extended lunch breaks in the middle of the day to go for a run and then eat lunch back at my apartment. I also signed a deal to write my fourth book, <em>So Good They Can’t Ignore You </em>, during this period—a project, of course, that soon levied its own intense demands on my time. </p><p>To compensate for these new constraints, I refined my ability to work deeply. Among other methods, I began to <span id=\"page-260\">&nbsp;</span>more carefully block out deep work hours and preserve them against incursion. I also developed an ability to carefully work through thoughts </p></section></div>",
                    "during the many hours I spent on foot each week (a boon to my productivity), and became obsessive about finding disconnected locations conducive to focus. During the summer, for example, I would often work under the dome in Barker Engineering library—a pleasingly cavernous location that becomes too crowded when class is in session, and during the winter, I sought more obscure locations for some silence, eventually developing a preference for the small but well-appointed Lewis Music Library. At some point, I even bought a $50 high-end grid-lined lab notebook </p></section></div>",

After I’d taken a job as a computer science professor at Georgetown University in the fall of 2011, my obligations did in fact drastically increase. But I had been training for this moment. Not only did I preserve my research productivity; it actually <em>improved </em>. My previous rate of two good papers a year, which I maintained as an unencumbered graduate student, leapt to four good papers a year, on average, once I became </p></section></div>",
                    "a much more encumbered professor. </p><p>Impressive as this was to me, however, I was soon to learn that I had not yet reached the limits of what deep work could produce. This lesson would come during my third year as a professor. During my third year at Georgetown, which spanned the fall of 2013 through the summer of <span id=\"page-261\">&nbsp;</span>2014, I turned my attention back to my deep work habits, searching for more opportunities to improve. A big reason for this recommitment to depth is the book you’re currently reading—most of which was written during this period. Writing a </p></section></div>",
                    "seventy-thousand-word book manuscript, of course, placed a sudden new constraint on my already busy schedule, and I wanted to make sure my academic productivity didn’t take a corresponding hit. Another reason I turned back to depth was the looming tenure process. I had a year or two of publications left before my tenure case was submitted. <em>This </em>was the time, in other words, to make a statement about my abilities (especially given that my wife and I were planning on growing our family with a second child in the final year before tenure). The final reason I turned </p></section></div>",
                    "back to depth was more personal and (admittedly) a touch petulant. I had applied and been rejected for a well-respected grant that many of my colleagues were receiving. I was upset and embarrassed, so I decided that instead of just complaining or wallowing in self-doubt, I would compensate for losing the grant by increasing the rate and impressiveness of my publications—allowing them to declare on my behalf that I actually <em>did </em>know what I was doing, even if this one particular grant application didn’t go my way. </p><p>I was already an adept deep worker, but these three forces </p></section></div>",
                    "drove me to push this habit to an extreme. I became ruthless in turning down time-consuming commitments and began to work more in isolated locations outside my office. I placed a tally of my deep work hours in a prominent position near my desk and got upset when it failed to grow at a fast enough <span id=\"page-262\">&nbsp;</span>rate. Perhaps most impactful, I returned to my MIT habit of working on problems in my head whenever a good time presented itself—be it walking the dog or commuting. Whereas earlier, I tended to increase my deep work only as a deadline approached, this year I was </p></section></div>",
                    "relentless—most every day of most every week I was pushing my mind to grapple with results of consequence, regardless of whether or not a specific deadline was near. I solved proofs on subway rides and while shoveling snow. When my son napped on the weekend, I would pace the yard thinking, and when stuck in traffic I would methodically work through problems that were stymieing me. </p><p>As this year progressed, I became a deep work machine—and the result of this transformation caught me off guard. During the same year that I wrote a book and my oldest son entered the terrible twos, I </p></section></div>",

It’s a commitment to this skill that allowed Bill Gates to make the </p></section></div>",

It requires hard work and drastic changes to your habits. For many, there’s a comfort in the artificial busyness of rapid e-mail messaging and social media posturing, while the deep life demands that you leave much of that behind. There’s also an </p></section></div>",

At one point, in her mid-twenties, collection agencies were hounding her to recover $10,000 in debts. An old résumé listed her longest job as lasting less than a year. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">The woman in front of the researchers today, however, was </p>",
                    "lean and vibrant, with the toned legs of a runner. She looked a decade younger than the photos in her chart and like she could out-exercise anyone in the room. According to the most recent report in her file, Lisa had no outstanding debts, didn’t drink, and was in her thirty-ninth month at a graphic design firm. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">“How long since your last cigarette?” one of the physicians asked, starting down the list of questions Lisa answered every time she came to this laboratory outside Bethesda, Maryland. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\"><span id=\"pagexii\">&nbsp;</span>“Almost four years,” she said, “and I’ve lost sixty pounds and run a </p>",
                    "marathon since then.” She’d also started a master’s degree and bought a home. It had been an eventful stretch. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">The scientists in the room included neurologists, psychologists, geneticists, and a sociologist. For the past three years, with funding from the National Institutes of Health, they had poked and prodded Lisa and more than two dozen other former smokers, chronic overeaters, problem drinkers, obsessive shoppers, and people with other destructive habits. All of the participants had one thing in common: They had remade their lives in relatively short </p>",
                    "periods of time. The researchers wanted to understand how. <span id=\"prl-nts1a\">&nbsp;</span>So they measured subjects’ vital signs, installed video cameras inside their homes to watch their daily routines, sequenced portions of their DNA, and, with technologies that allowed them to peer inside people’s skulls in real time, watched as blood and electrical impulses flowed through their brains while they were exposed to temptations such as cigarette smoke and lavish meals. <span class=\"hlink\" href=\"Duhi_9780679603856_epub_nts_r1.htm#prl-nts1\"><sup class=\"frac\">prl.1 </sup></span>The researchers’ goal was to figure out how habits work on a neurological level—and what it took to make them change. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">“I know you’ve told this story a </p>",
                    "dozen times,” the doctor said to Lisa, “but some of my colleagues have only heard it secondhand. Would you mind describing again how you gave up cigarettes?” </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">“Sure,” Lisa said. “It started in Cairo.” The vacation had been something of a rash decision, she explained. A few months earlier, her husband had come home from work and announced that he was leaving her because he was in love with another woman. It took Lisa a while to process the betrayal and absorb the fact that she was actually getting a divorce. There was a period of mourning, then a period of obsessively spying on </p>",
                    "him, following his new girlfriend around town, calling her after midnight and hanging up. Then there was the evening Lisa showed up at the girlfriend’s house, drunk, pounding on her door and screaming that she was going to burn the condo down. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\"><span id=\"pagexiii\">&nbsp;</span>“It wasn’t a great time for me,” Lisa said. “I had always wanted to see the pyramids, and my credit cards weren’t maxed out yet, so … ” </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">On her first morning in Cairo, Lisa woke at dawn to the sound of the call to prayer from a nearby mosque. It was pitch black inside her hotel room. Half blind and jet-lagged, she reached for a cigarette. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\"></p>",
                    "She was so disoriented that she didn’t realize—until she smelled burning plastic—that she was trying to light a pen, not a Marlboro. She had spent the past four months crying, binge eating, unable to sleep, and feeling ashamed, helpless, depressed, and angry, all at once. Lying in bed, she broke down. “It was like this wave of sadness,” she said. “I felt like everything I had ever wanted had crumbled. I couldn’t even smoke right. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">“And then I started thinking about my ex-husband, and how hard it would be to find another job when I got back, and how much I was </p>",
                    "going to hate it and how unhealthy I felt all the time. I got up and knocked over a water jug and it shattered on the floor, and I started crying even harder. I felt desperate, like I had to change something, at least one thing I could control.” </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">She showered and left the hotel. As she rode through Cairo’s rutted streets in a taxi and then onto the dirt roads leading to the Sphinx, the pyramids of Giza, and the vast, endless desert around them, her self-pity, for a brief moment, gave way. She needed a goal in her life, she thought. Something to work toward. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">So she decided, sitting in the taxi, </p>",
                    "that she would come back to Egypt and trek through the desert. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">It was a crazy idea, Lisa knew. She was out of shape, overweight, with no money in the bank. She didn’t know the name of the desert she was looking at or if such a trip was possible. None of that mattered, though. She needed something to focus on. Lisa decided that she would give herself one year to prepare. And to survive such an expedition, she was certain she would have to make sacrifices. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">In particular, she would need to quit smoking. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\"><span id=\"pagexiv\">&nbsp;</span>When Lisa finally made her way across the desert eleven months </p>",
                    "later—in an air-conditioned and motorized tour with a half-dozen other people, mind you—the caravan carried so much water, food, tents, maps, global positioning systems, and two-way radios that throwing in a carton of cigarettes wouldn’t have made much of a difference. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">But in the taxi, Lisa didn’t know that. And to the scientists at the laboratory, the details of her trek weren’t relevant. Because for reasons they were just beginning to understand, that one small shift in Lisa’s perception that day in Cairo—the conviction that she <em>had </em>to give up smoking to accomplish her </p>",
                    "goal—had touched off a series of changes that would ultimately radiate out to every part of her life. Over the next six months, she would replace smoking with jogging, and that, in turn, changed how she ate, worked, slept, saved money, scheduled her workdays, planned for the future, and so on. She would start running half-marathons, and then a marathon, go back to school, buy a house, and get engaged. Eventually she was recruited into the scientists’ study, and when researchers began examining images of Lisa’s brain, they saw something remarkable: One set of neurological </p>",
                    "patterns—her old habits—had been overridden by new patterns. They could still see the neural activity of her old behaviors, but those impulses were crowded out by new urges. As Lisa’s habits changed, so had her brain. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">It wasn’t the trip to Cairo that had caused the shift, scientists were convinced, or the divorce or desert trek. It was that Lisa had focused on changing just one habit—smoking—at first. Everyone in the study had gone through a similar process. By focusing on one pattern—what is known as a “keystone habit”—Lisa had taught herself how to reprogram the other routines in her </p>",
                    "life, as well. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">It’s not just individuals who are capable of such shifts. When companies focus on changing habits, whole organizations can transform. Firms such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Starbucks, Alcoa, and Target have seized on this insight to influence how work gets done, <span id=\"pagexv\">&nbsp;</span>how employees communicate, and—without customers realizing it—the way people shop. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">“I want to show you one of your most recent scans,” a researcher told Lisa near the end of her exam. He pulled up a picture on a computer screen that showed images from inside her head. </p>",
                    "“When you see food, these areas”—he pointed to a place near the center of her brain—“which are associated with craving and hunger, are still active. Your brain still produces the urges that made you overeat. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">“However, there’s new activity in this area”—he pointed to the region closest to her forehead—“where we believe behavioral inhibition and self-discipline starts. That activity has become more pronounced each time you’ve come in.” </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Lisa was the scientists’ favorite participant because her brain scans were so compelling, so useful in creating a map of where </p>",

It focuses on habits as they are technically defined: the choices that all of us deliberately make at some point, and then stop thinking about but continue doing, often every day. At one point, we all consciously decided how much to eat and what to focus on when we got to the office, how often to have a drink or when to go for a jog.

Researchers at Duke, Harvard, UCLA, Yale, USC, Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania, and at schools in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands, as well as corporate scientists working for Procter &amp; Gamble, Microsoft, Google, and hundreds of other companies are focused on understanding the neurology and psychology of habits, their strengths and weaknesses, and why they emerge and how they can be changed. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\"></p>",

Routines can be incredibly complex or fantastically simple (some habits, such as those related to emotions, are measured in milliseconds). Rewards can range from food or drugs that cause physical sensations, to emotional payoffs, such as the feelings of pride that accompany praise or self-congratulation. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">And in almost every experiment, </p>",
                    "researchers have seen echoes of Squire’s discoveries with Eugene: Habits are powerful, but delicate. They can emerge outside our consciousness, or can be deliberately designed. They often occur without our permission, but can be reshaped by fiddling with their parts. They shape our lives far more than we realize—they are so strong, in fact, that they cause our brains to cling to them at the exclusion of all else, including common sense. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\"><span id=\"page26\">&nbsp;</span>In one set of experiments, for example, researchers affiliated with the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism trained mice </p>",

Consider fast food, for instance. It makes sense—when the kids are starving and you’re driving home after a long day—to stop, just this once, at McDonald’s or Burger King. The meals are inexpensive. It tastes so good. After all, one dose of processed meat, salty fries, and sugary soda poses a relatively small health risk, right?

The foods at some chains are specifically engineered to deliver immediate rewards—the fries, for instance, are designed to begin disintegrating the moment they hit your tongue, in order to deliver a hit of salt and grease as fast as possible, causing your pleasure centers to light up and your brain to lock in the pattern. <span>&nbsp;</span>All the better for tightening the habit loop. <span class=\"hlink\" href=\"Duhi_9780679603856_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts25\" id=\"c01-nts25a\"><sup class=\"frac\">1.25 </sup></span></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\"></p>",

When a fast food restaurant closes down, the families that previously ate there will often start having dinner at home, rather than seek out an alternative location. Even small shifts can end the pattern. But since we often don’t recognize these habit loops as they grow, we are blind to our ability to control them.

He couldn’t tell the difference. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">As he got older, however, Eugene’s habits started impacting his life in negative ways.

                    "to keep him on a strict diet of healthy foods. She tried, but it was difficult to influence how frequently he ate or what he consumed. He never recalled her admonitions. Even if the refrigerator was stocked with fruits and vegetables, Eugene would root around until he found the bacon and eggs. That was his routine. And as Eugene aged and his bones became more brittle, the doctors said he <span id=\"page28\">&nbsp;</span>needed to be more careful walking around. In his mind, however, Eugene was twenty years younger. He never remembered to step carefully. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">“All my life I was fascinated by memory,” Squire told me. “Then I </p>",

One spring day, Eugene was watching television when he suddenly shouted. Beverly ran in and saw him clutching his chest. She called an ambulance. At the hospital, they diagnosed a minor heart attack. By then the pain had passed and Eugene was fighting to get off his gurney. That night, he kept pulling off the monitors attached to his chest so he could roll over and </p>",

He forgot the threats as soon as they were issued. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Then his daughter told a nurse to try complimenting him on his willingness to sit still, and to repeat the compliment, over and over, each time she saw him. “We wanted to, you know, get his pride involved,” his daughter, Carol Rayes, told me. “We’d say, ‘Oh, Dad, you’re really doing something </p>",

Eugene returned home a week later. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Then, in the fall of 2008, while walking through his living room, Eugene tripped on a ledge near the fireplace, fell, and broke his hip. At the hospital, Squire and his team worried that he would have panic attacks because he wouldn’t know where he was. So they left notes by his bedside explaining what had happened and posted photos of his children on the walls. His wife and kids came every day. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\"></p>",
                    "Eugene, however, never grew worried. He never asked why he was in the hospital. “He seemed at peace with all the uncertainty by that point,” said Squire. “It had been fifteen years since he had lost his memory. It was as if part of his brain knew there were some things he would never understand and was okay with that.” </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Beverly came to the hospital every day. “I spent a long time talking to him,” she said. “I told him that I loved him, and about our kids and what a good life we had. I pointed to the pictures and talked about how much he was adored. We were married for fifty-seven years, and </p>",
                    "forty-two of those were a real, normal marriage. Sometimes it was hard, because I wanted my old husband back so much. But at least I knew he was happy.” </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">A few weeks later, his daughter came to visit. “What’s the plan?” Eugene asked when she arrived. She took him outside in a wheelchair, onto the hospital’s lawn. “It’s a beautiful day,” Eugene said. “Pretty nice weather, huh?” She told him about her kids and they played with a dog. She thought he might be able to come home soon. The sun was going down. She started to get ready to take him inside. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\"></p>",

Hopkins was approached by an old friend with a </p>",
                    "new business idea. The friend had discovered an amazing product, he explained, that he was convinced would be a hit. It was a toothpaste, a minty, frothy concoction he called “Pepsodent.” There were some dicey investors involved—one of them had a string of busted land deals; another, it was rumored, was connected to the mob—but this venture, the friend promised, was going to be huge. If, that is, <span id=\"c02-nts1a\">&nbsp;</span>Hopkins would consent to help design a national promotional campaign. <span class=\"hlink\" href=\"Duhi_9780679603856_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts1\"><sup class=\"frac\">2.1 </sup></span></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Hopkins, at the time, was at the top of a booming industry that had hardly existed a few decades </p>",
                    "earlier: advertising. Hopkins was the man who had convinced Americans to buy Schlitz beer by boasting that the company cleaned their bottles “with live steam,” while neglecting to mention that every other company used the exact same method. He had seduced millions of women into purchasing <span id=\"page32\">&nbsp;</span>Palmolive soap by proclaiming that Cleopatra had washed with it, despite the sputtering protests of outraged historians. He had made Puffed Wheat famous by saying that it was “shot from guns” until the grains puffed “to eight times normal size.” He had turned dozens </p>",
                    "of previously unknown products—Quaker Oats, Goodyear tires, the Bissell carpet sweeper, Van Camp’s pork and beans—into household names. And in the process, he had made himself so rich that his best-selling autobiography, <em>My Life in Advertising, </em>devoted long passages to the difficulties of spending so much money. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Claude Hopkins was best known for a series of rules he coined explaining how to create new habits among consumers. These rules would transform industries and eventually became conventional wisdom among marketers, educational reformers, </p>",
                    "public health professionals, politicians, and CEOs. Even today, Hopkins’s rules influence everything from how we buy cleaning supplies to the tools governments use for eradicating disease. They are fundamental to creating any new routine. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">However, when his old friend approached Hopkins about Pepsodent, the ad man expressed only mild interest. It was no secret that the health of Americans’ teeth was in steep decline. <span id=\"c02-nts2a\">&nbsp;</span>As the nation had become wealthier, people had started buying larger amounts of sugary, processed foods. <span class=\"hlink\" href=\"Duhi_9780679603856_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts2\"><sup class=\"frac\">2.2 </sup></span>When the government started drafting </p>",

There was already an army of door-to-door salesmen hawking dubious tooth powders and elixirs, most of them going broke. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">The problem was that hardly anyone bought toothpaste because, despite the nation’s dental problems, <span id=\"c02-nts3a\">&nbsp;</span>hardly anyone brushed their teeth. <span class=\"hlink\" href=\"Duhi_9780679603856_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts3\"><sup class=\"frac\">2.3 </sup></span></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">So Hopkins gave his friend’s proposal a bit of thought, and then declined. He’d stick with soaps and </p>",
                    "cereals, he said. “I did not see a way to educate the laity in technical tooth-paste theories,” Hopkins <span id=\"page33\">&nbsp;</span>explained in his autobiography. The friend, however, was persistent. He came back again and again, appealing to Hopkins’s considerable ego until, eventually, the ad man gave in. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">“I finally agreed to undertake the campaign if he gave me a six months’ option on a block of stock,” Hopkins wrote.

                    "best-known products on earth and, in the process, helped create a toothbrushing habit that moved across America with startling speed. Soon, <span id=\"c02-nts4a\">&nbsp;</span>everyone from Shirley Temple to Clark Gable was bragging about their “Pepsodent smile.” <span class=\"hlink\" href=\"Duhi_9780679603856_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts4\"><sup class=\"frac\">2.4 </sup></span><span id=\"c02-nts5a\">&nbsp;</span>By 1930, Pepsodent was sold in China, South Africa, Brazil, Germany, and almost anywhere else Hopkins could buy ads. <span class=\"hlink\" href=\"Duhi_9780679603856_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts5\"><sup class=\"frac\">2.5 </sup></span><span id=\"c02-nts6a\">&nbsp;</span>A decade after the first Pepsodent campaign, pollsters found that toothbrushing had become a ritual for more than half the American population. <span class=\"hlink\" href=\"Duhi_9780679603856_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts6\"><sup class=\"frac\">2.6 </sup></span>Hopkins had helped establish toothbrushing as a daily </p>",

It’s an alchemy so powerful that even today the basic principles are still used video game designers, food companies, hospitals, and millions of salesmen around the world. Eugene Pauly taught us about the habit loop, but it was Claude Hopkins that showed how new habits can be cultivated and grown. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">So what, exactly, did Hopkins do? </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">He created a craving.

He sold Quaker Oats, for instance, as a breakfast cereal that could provide energy for twenty-four hours—but only if you ate a bowl every morning. He hawked tonics that cured stomachaches, joint pain, bad skin, and “womanly problems”—but only if you drank the medicine at symptoms’ first </p>",
                    "appearance. Soon, people were devouring oatmeal at daybreak and chugging from little brown bottles whenever they felt a hint of fatigue, which, as luck would have it, often happened at least once a day. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">To sell Pepsodent, then, Hopkins needed a trigger that would justify the toothpaste’s daily use. He sat down with a pile of dental textbooks. “It was dry reading,” he later wrote. “But in the middle of one book I found a reference to the mucin plaques on teeth, which I afterward called ‘the film.’ That gave me an appealing idea. I resolved to advertise this </p>",
                    "toothpaste as a creator of beauty. To deal with that cloudy film.” </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">In focusing on tooth film, Hopkins was ignoring the fact that this same film has always covered people’s teeth and hadn’t seemed to bother anyone. <span id=\"c02-nts7a\">&nbsp;</span>The film is a naturally occurring membrane that builds up on teeth regardless of what you eat or how often you brush. <span class=\"hlink\" href=\"Duhi_9780679603856_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts7\"><sup class=\"frac\">2.7 </sup></span>People had never paid much attention to it, and there was little reason why they should: You can get rid of the film by eating an apple, running your finger over your teeth, brushing, or vigorously swirling liquid around your mouth. Toothpaste didn’t do anything to </p>",
                    "help remove the film. In fact, one of the leading dental researchers of the time said that all toothpastes— <span id=\"c02-nts8a\">&nbsp;</span>particularly Pepsodent—were worthless. <span class=\"hlink\" href=\"Duhi_9780679603856_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts8\"><sup class=\"frac\">2.8 </sup></span></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">That didn’t stop Hopkins from exploiting his discovery. Here, he decided, was a cue that could trigger a habit. Soon, cities were plastered with Pepsodent ads. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">“Just run your tongue across your teeth,” read one. “ <em>You’ll feel a film— </em>that’s what makes your teeth look ‘off color’ and invites decay.” </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">“Note how many pretty teeth are seen everywhere,” read another ad, featuring smiling beauties. “Millions are using a new method of <span id=\"page35\">&nbsp;</span>teeth </p>",
                    "cleansing. Why would any woman have dingy film on her teeth? <span>&nbsp;</span>Pepsodent removes the film!” <span class=\"hlink\" href=\"Duhi_9780679603856_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts9\" id=\"c02-nts9a\"><sup class=\"frac\">2.9 </sup></span></p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">The brilliance of these appeals was that they relied upon a cue—tooth film—that was universal and impossible to ignore. Telling someone to run their tongue across their teeth, it turned out, was likely to cause them to run their tongue across their teeth. And when they did, they were likely to feel a film. Hopkins had found a cue that was simple, had existed for ages, and was so easy to trigger that an advertisement could cause people to comply automatically. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Moreover, the reward, as Hopkins </p>",
                    "envisioned it, was even more enticing. Who, after all, doesn’t want to be more beautiful? Who doesn’t want a prettier smile? Particularly when all it takes is a quick brush with Pepsodent? </p><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"image_wrap\"><p class=\"center\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"caption\"><span class=\"small\">HOPKINS’S CONCEPTION OF THE PEPSODENT HABIT LOOP </span></p></div><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">After the campaign launched, a quiet week passed.

And within Julio’s brain, Schultz watched a new pattern emerge: craving. When Julio anticipated juice but didn’t receive it, a neurological pattern associated with desire and frustration erupted inside his skull. When Julio saw the cue, he started anticipating a juice-fueled joy. But if the juice didn’t arrive, that joy became a craving that, if unsatisfied, drove Julio to anger or depression. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\"></p>",

                    "that way. I use it for normal cleaning—a couple of sprays when I’m done in a room.

Rather, they changed because they were embedded in social groups that made change easier. One woman said her entire life shifted when she signed up for a psychology class and met a wonderful group. “It opened a Pandora’s box,” the woman told researchers. “I could not tolerate the status quo any longer. I had changed in my core.” Another man said that he found new friends among whom he could practice being gregarious. “When I </p>",

But by practicing with <span id=\"page89\">&nbsp;</span>his new group, it stopped feeling like acting. He started to believe he wasn’t shy, and then, eventually, he wasn’t anymore. When people join groups where change seems possible, the potential for that change to occur becomes more real.

And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">If you want to quit smoking, figure out a different routine that will satisfy the cravings filled by cigarettes.

Belief is essential, and it grows out of a communal experience, even if that community is only as large as two people. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">We know that change <em>can </em>happen. </p>",

Alcoa’s management had made misstep after misstep, unwisely trying to expand into new product lines while competitors stole customers and profits away. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">So there had been a palpable sense of relief when Alcoa’s board <span id=\"page98\">&nbsp;</span>announced it was time for new leadership.

                    "bureaucrat named Paul O’Neill. Many on Wall Street had never heard of him. When Alcoa scheduled this meet and greet at the Manhattan ballroom, every major investor asked for an invitation. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">A few minutes before noon, O’Neill took the stage. He was fifty-one years old, trim, and dressed in gray pinstripes and a red power tie. His hair was white and his posture military straight. He bounced up the steps and smiled warmly. He looked dignified, solid, confident. Like a chief executive. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Then he opened his mouth. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">“I want to talk to you about worker </p>",
                    "safety,” he said. “Every year, numerous Alcoa workers are injured so badly that they miss a day of work. Our safety record is better than the general American workforce, especially considering that our employees work with metals that are 1500 degrees and machines that can rip a man’s arm off. But it’s not good enough. I intend to make Alcoa the safest company in America. I intend to go for zero injuries.” </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">The audience was confused.

Next would come an excoriation of taxes, business regulations, and sometimes, with a fervor that suggested firsthand experience in divorce court, lawyers.

He didn’t mention taxes. There was no talk of “using </p>",
                    "alignment to achieve a win-win synergistic market advantage.” For all anyone in the audience knew, <span id=\"page99\">&nbsp;</span>given his talk of worker safety, O’Neill might be pro-regulation. Or, worse, a Democrat. It was a terrifying prospect. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">“Now, before I go any further,” O’Neill said, “I want to point out the safety exits in this room.” He gestured to the rear of the ballroom. “There’s a couple of doors in the back, and in the unlikely event of a fire or other emergency, you should calmly walk out, go down the stairs to the lobby, and leave the building.” </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Silence.

Another asked about the company’s capital ratios. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">“I’m not certain you heard me,” O’Neill said. “If you want to understand how Alcoa is doing, you need to look at our workplace safety figures.

It will be because the individuals at this company have agreed to become part of something important: They’ve devoted themselves to creating a habit of excellence. Safety will be an indicator that we’re making progress in changing our habits across the entire institution. That’s how we should be judged.” </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">The investors in the room almost stampeded out the doors when the presentation ended.

Before O’Neill’s arrival, almost every Alcoa plant had at least one accident per week. Once his safety plan was implemented, some facilities would go years without a single employee losing a workday due to an accident. The company’s worker injury rate fell to one-twentieth the U.S. average. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">So how did O’Neill make one of the </p>",

Sure, a tragic accident had occurred, but tragic accidents were part of life at Alcoa. It was a huge company with employees who handled red-hot metal and dangerous machines. “Paul had come in as an outsider, and there was a lot of skepticism when he talked about safety,” said Bill O’rourke, a top executive. “We figured it would last a few weeks, and then he would start focusing on something else. But that meeting really shook everyone up. </p>",

Managers told employees not to be afraid to suggest proactive maintenance, and rules were clarified so that no one would attempt unsafe repairs.

So to lower infant mortality, improve mothers’ diets. Simple, right?

All of them had recently undergone hip or knee replacement surgeries, but because they were relatively poor and uneducated, many had waited years for their operations. They were retirees, elderly mechanics, and store clerks. They were in life’s final chapters, and most had no desire to pick up a new book. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Recovering from a hip or knee surgery is incredibly arduous. The operation involves severing joint muscles and sawing through </p>",

However, it is essential that patients begin exercising almost as soon as they wake from surgery. They must begin moving their legs and hips before the muscles and skin have healed, or scar tissue will clog the joint, destroying its flexibility. <span id=\"page142\">&nbsp;</span>In addition, if patients don’t start exercising, they risk developing blood clots. But the agony is so extreme that it’s not unusual for people to skip out on rehab sessions. Patients, particularly elderly ones, often refuse to comply </p>",

The scientist conducting the experiment wanted to see if it was possible to help them harness their willpower. She gave each patient a booklet after their surgeries that detailed their rehab schedule, and in the back were thirteen additional pages—one for each week—with blank spaces and instructions: “My goals for this week are __________ ? Write down exactly what you are going to do. For example, if you are going to go for a walk this week, write down </p>",
                    "where and when you are going to walk.” She asked patients to fill in each of those pages with specific plans.

The patients who had written plans in their booklets had started walking almost twice </p>",

She examined the booklets, and discovered that most of the blank pages had been filled in with specific, detailed plans about the most mundane aspects of recovery. One patient, for example, had written, “I will walk to the bus stop tomorrow to meet my </p>",
                    "wife from work,” and then noted what time he would leave, the route he would walk, what he would <span id=\"page143\">&nbsp;</span>wear, which coat he would bring if it was raining, and what pills he would take if the pain became too much. Another patient, in a similar study, wrote a series of very specific schedules regarding the exercises he would do each time he went to the bathroom. A third wrote a minute-by-minute itinerary for walking around the block. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">As the psychologist scrutinized the booklets, she saw that many of the plans had something in common: They focused on how patients would handle a specific moment of </p>",
                    "anticipated pain. The man who exercised on the way to the bathroom, for instance, knew that each time he stood up from the couch, the ache was excruciating.

The patient who met his wife at the bus stop dreaded the afternoons, because that stroll was the longest and most painful each day.

His entire life revolved around using data to understand people. He had grown up in a small North Dakota town, </p>",
                    "and while his friends were attending 4-H or building model rockets, Pole was playing with computers. After college, he got a graduate degree in statistics and then another in economics, and while most of his classmates in the econ program at the University of Missouri were headed to insurance companies or government bureaucracies, Pole was on a different track. He’d become obsessed with the ways economists were using pattern analysis to explain human behavior. Pole, in fact, had tried his hand at a few informal experiments <span id=\"page183\">&nbsp;</span>himself. He once threw a party and </p>",
                    "polled everyone on their favorite jokes, and then attempted to create a mathematical model for the perfect one-liner. He had sought to calculate the exact amount of beer he needed to drink in order to work up the confidence to talk to women at parties, but not so much that he would make a fool of himself. (That particular study never seemed to come out right.) </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">But those experiments were child’s play, he knew, to how corporate America was using data to scrutinize people’s lives. Pole wanted in. So when he graduated and heard that Hallmark, the greeting card company, was </p>",
                    "looking to hire statisticians in Kansas City, he submitted an application and was soon spending his days scouring sales data to determine if pictures of pandas or elephants sold more birthday cards, and if “What Happens at Grandma’s Stays at Grandma’s” is funnier in red or blue ink. It was heaven. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Six years later, in 2002, when Pole learned that Target was looking for number crunchers, he made the jump. Target, he knew, was a whole other magnitude when it came to data collection. Every year, millions of shoppers walked into Target’s 1,147 stores and handed over </p>",
                    "terabytes of information about themselves. Most had no idea they were doing it. They used their customer loyalty cards, redeemed coupons they had received in the mail, or used a credit card, unaware that Target could then link their purchases to an individualized demographic profile. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">To a statistician, this data was a magic window for peering into customers’ preferences. Target sold everything from groceries to clothing, electronics and lawn furniture, and by closely tracking people’s buying habits, the company’s analysts could predict what was occurring within their </p>",
                    "homes. Someone’s buying new towels, sheets, silverware, pans, and frozen dinners? They probably just bought a new house—or are getting a divorce. A cart loaded up with bug spray, kids’ underwear, a flashlight, lots of batteries, <em>Real Simple, </em>and a bottle of Chardonnay? Summer camp is around the corner and Mom can hardly wait. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\"><span id=\"page184\">&nbsp;</span>Working at Target offered Pole a chance to study the most complicated of creatures—the American shopper—in its natural habitat. His job was to build mathematical models that could crawl through data and determine </p>",
                    "which households contained kids and which were dedicated bachelors; which shoppers loved the outdoors and who was more interested in ice cream and romance novels. Pole’s mandate was to become a mathematical mind reader, deciphering shoppers’ habits in order to convince them to spend more. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Then, one afternoon, a few of Pole’s colleagues from the marketing department stopped by his desk. They were trying to figure out which of Target’s customers were pregnant based on their buying patterns, they said. Pregnant women and new parents, after all, </p>",
                    "are the holy grail of retail. There is almost no more profitable, product-hungry, price-insensitive group in existence. It’s not just diapers and wipes. People with infants are so tired that they’ll buy everything they need—juice and toilet paper, socks and magazines—wherever they purchase their bottles and formula. What’s more, if a new parent starts shopping at Target, they’ll keep coming back for years. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Figuring out who was pregnant, in other words, could make Target millions of dollars. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Pole was intrigued.

He would learn, for example, that hiding what you know is sometimes as important as knowing it, and that not all women are enthusiastic about a computer program scrutinizing their reproductive plans. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Not everyone, it turns out, thinks mathematical mind reading is cool. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">“I guess outsiders could say this is </p>",

As little as twenty years ago retailers didn’t do this kind of intensely data-driven analysis. Instead, Target, as well as grocery stores, shopping malls, greeting card sellers, clothing retailers, and other firms, tried to peer inside consumers’ heads the old-fashioned way: by hiring psychologists who peddled vaguely scientific tactics they claimed could make customers </p>",

If you walk into a Walmart, Home Depot, or your local shopping center and look closely, you’ll see retailing tricks that have been around for decades, each designed to exploit your shopping subconscious. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Take, for instance, how you buy food. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Chances are, the first things you see upon entering your grocery store are fruits and vegetables arranged in attractive, bountiful piles. If you think about it, positioning produce at the front of a store doesn’t make much sense, </p>",
                    "because fruits and vegetables bruise easily at the bottom of a shopping cart; logically, they should be situated by the registers, so they come at the end of a trip. But as marketers and psychologists figured out long ago, if we <em>start </em>our shopping sprees by loading up on healthy stuff, we’re much more likely to buy Doritos, Oreos, and frozen pizza when we encounter them later on. The burst of subconscious virtuousness that comes from first buying butternut squash makes it easier to put a pint of ice cream in the cart later. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Or take the way most of us turn to the right after entering a store. (Did </p>",

As a result of this tendency, retailers fill the right side of the store with the most profitable products they’re hoping you’ll buy right off the bat. Or consider cereal and soups: When they’re shelved out of alphabetical order and seemingly at random, our instinct is to linger a bit longer and look at a <span id=\"page186\">&nbsp;</span>wider selection. So you’ll rarely find Raisin Bran next to Rice Chex. Instead, you’ll have to search the shelves for the cereal you want, and maybe </p>",

They’re fairly primitive, one-size-fits-all solutions for triggering buying habits. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">In the past two decades, however, as the retail marketplace has become more and more competitive, chains such as Target began to understand they couldn’t rely on the same old bag of tricks. The only way to increase profits was to figure out each individual shopper’s habits and to market to people one by one, with </p>",
                    "personalized pitches designed to appeal to customers’ unique buying preferences. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">In part, this realization came from a growing awareness of how powerfully habits influence almost every shopping decision. A series of experiments convinced marketers that if they managed to understand a particular shopper’s habits, they could get them <span id=\"c07-nts2a\">&nbsp;</span>to buy almost anything. <span class=\"hlink\" href=\"Duhi_9780679603856_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts2\"><sup class=\"frac\">7.2 </sup></span>One study tape-recorded consumers as they walked through grocery stores.

I will skip them. Wait a minute. Oh! The Lay’s <span id=\"c07-nts3a\">&nbsp;</span>potato chips are on sale!” He put a bag in his cart. <span class=\"hlink\" href=\"Duhi_9780679603856_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts3\"><sup class=\"frac\">7.3 </sup></span>Some shoppers bought the </p>",

What else is there?” one woman said as she stood in front of a shelf containing dozens of other coffee <span id=\"page187\">&nbsp;</span>brands). Shoppers bought roughly the same amount of food each time they went shopping, even if they had pledged to cut back. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">“Consumers sometimes act like creatures of habit, automatically repeating past behavior with little regard to current goals,” two psychologists at the <span id=\"c07-nts4a\">&nbsp;</span>University of Southern California wrote in 2009. <span class=\"hlink\" href=\"Duhi_9780679603856_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts4\"><sup class=\"frac\"></sup></span></p>",

The guy who liked potato chips bought a bag every time, but the Folgers woman never went down the potato chip aisle. There were people who bought milk whenever they shopped—even if they had plenty at home—and there were people who always purchased desserts when they said they were trying to lose weight. But the milk buyers and the dessert addicts didn’t usually overlap. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\"></p>",

A record of each purchase was linked to that shopper’s Guest ID number along with information on everything else they’d ever bought. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Also linked to that Guest ID number was demographic information <span id=\"page188\">&nbsp;</span>that Target collected or purchased from </p>",

His father was a wealthy and prominent theologian. His brother, Henry, was a brilliant, successful writer whose novels are still studied <span id=\"page272\">&nbsp;</span>today. William, into his thirties, was the unaccomplished one in the family. He was sick as a child. He wanted to become a painter, and then enrolled in medical school, then left to join an expedition up the Amazon River. Then he quit that, as well. He chastised himself </p>",

In medical school, he had visited a hospital for the insane and had seen a man hurling himself against a wall. The patient, a doctor explained, suffered from hallucinations. James didn’t say that he often felt like he shared more in common with the patients than his fellow physicians. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">“Today I about touched bottom, and perceive plainly that I must face the choice with open eyes,” James wrote in his diary in 1870, when he was twenty-eight years old. “Shall I frankly throw the moral </p>",

Before doing anything rash, he would conduct a yearlong experiment. He would spend twelve months believing that he had control over himself and his destiny, that he could become better, that he had the free will to change. There was no proof that it was true. But he would free himself to <em>believe, </em>all evidence to the contrary, that change was possible. “I think that yesterday was a crisis in my life,” he wrote in his diary. </p>",
                    "Regarding his ability to change, “I will assume for the present—until next year—that it is no illusion. My first act of free will shall be to believe in free will.” </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">Over the next year, he practiced every day. In his diary, he wrote as if his control over himself and his choices was never in question. He got married. He started teaching at Harvard. He began spending time with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who would go on to become a Supreme Court justice, and Charles Sanders Peirce, a pioneer in the study of semiotics, in a discussion group they called <span>&nbsp;</span>the Metaphysical Club. <span class=\"hlink\" href=\"Duhi_9780679603856_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts30\" id=\"c09-nts30a\"><sup class=\"frac\">9.30 </sup></span>Two years after writing his diary </p>",

                    "important ingredient in creating belief in change. And that one of the most important methods for creating that belief was habits. Habits, he noted, are what allow us to “do a thing with difficulty the first time, but soon do it more and more easily, and finally, with sufficient practice, do it semi-mechanically, or with hardly any consciousness at all.” Once we choose who we want to be, people grow “to the way in which they have been exercised, just as a sheet of paper or a coat, once creased or folded, tends to fall forever afterward into the same identical folds.” </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">If you believe you can change—if </p>",
                    "you make it a habit—the change becomes real. This is the real power of habit: the insight that your habits are what you choose them to be. Once that choice occurs—and becomes automatic—it’s not only real, it starts to seem inevitable, the thing, as James wrote, that bears “us irresistibly toward our destiny, whatever the latter may be.” </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"indent\">The way we habitually think of our surroundings and ourselves create the worlds that each of us inhabit. “There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says ‘Morning, boys.

He eventually devoted an entire chapter in his masterpiece <em>The Principles of </em></p>",
                    "Psychology </em>to the topic. Water, he said, is the most apt analogy for how a habit works.
